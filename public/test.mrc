Strengthening Military Social Work Through the Development of a Global Understanding of Practice Similarities and Differences.  aThis is the first book to focus on the scope of social work practice within military settings from an international perspective, and therefore addresses what has been a significant gap in the literature. Given the critical support needs of military personnel and their families worldwide, and the expanding role of social work in responding to these needs, this book offers a comprehensive global understanding of the common military social work (MilSW) practices with active duty military service members and their families, as well as the forms of practice and approaches that are unique, or potentially transferable across nations. Based on a systematic inquiry conducted by the Editors, there are at least 25 countries that have social workers working directly within their country’s military in either a civilian or uniformed capacity, or both. This book includes contributions from experts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK, and the USA, who describe various aspects of the MilSW role within their country and the research that informs what military social workers do. The MilSW similarities and differences among these countries are highlighted, including developmental milestones, practice settings, practice orientation and approach, ethical dilemmas, military to veteran transition support, and past and current challenges. Experts from countries that do not yet have MilSW but are interested in developing it (Japan, Ukraine) or are in the process of establishing this area of practice (Slovakia), also contribute chapters about these developments and the evidence base that supports this direction. Military Social Work Around the Globe is a valuable resource for social work programs and essential reading for instructors and students in MilSW electives and specializations. It is also pertinent reading for occupational social work and international social work courses. In addition, this book is an important source of information for military social workers who would like to gain insights into existing programs and the possibilities for international collaboration, and for countries interested in developing MilSW. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aPolitics and war. 0aSocial service. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aSocial policy.14aClinical Social Work.24aMilitary and Defence Studies.24aSocial Work.24aOccupational Health Psychology.24aSocial Care.24aSocial Policy.1 aForgey, Mary Ann.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aGreen-Hurdle, Karen.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303114481308iPrinted edition:z978303114483708iPrinted edition:z9783031144844 0aMilitary and Veterans Studies,x2524-395040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14482-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)07868nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001600184072002300200072001600223082001700239245016500256250001800421264007500439300004500514336002600559337002600585338003600611347002400647505310600671506001603777520280103793650002506594650002906619650002506648650004506673700007806718700008906796700008106885710003406966773002607000776003607026776003607062776003607098856004607134912001407180912001507194912001407209950006107223950006607284978-3-031-10274-5DE-He21320230119151617.0cr nn 008mamaa221117s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311027459978-3-031-10274-57 a10.1007/978-3-031-10274-52doi 4aBF204.6 7aJMA2bicssc 7aPSY0450002bisacsh 7aJMAP2thema04a150.198822310aHandbook of Positive Psychology, Religion, and Spiritualityh[electronic resource] /cedited by Edward B.

It is the authoritative guide to the intersections among religion, spirituality, and positive psychology and includes the following sections: (1) historical and theoretical considerations, (2) methodological considerations, (3) cultural considerations, (4) developmental considerations, (5) empirical research on happiness and well-being in relation to religion and spirituality, (6) empirical research on character strengths and virtues in relation to religion and spirituality, (7) clinical and applied considerations, and (8) field unification and advancement. Leading positive psychologists and psychologists of religion/spirituality have coauthored the chapters, drawing on expertise from their respective fields. The handbook is useful for social and clinical scientists, practitioners in helping professions, practitioners in religious and spiritual fields, and students of psychology and religion/spirituality. A comprehensive resource examining the intersections of positive psychology and the psychology of religion/spirituality Draws connections between two fields that research has increasingly shown to be connected “This Handbook provides a masterful, comprehensive review of theory, research, and clinical applications at the exciting intersection between the psychology of religion/spirituality and positive psychology. It demonstrates each of those fields is incomplete without the other. This book should be in the shelf of every serious student of religion, spirituality, and psychology.” -Pehr Granqvist, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology, Stockholm University, Author of Attachment in Religion and Spirituality: A Wider View “Within this volume is found the next frontier of positive psychology, exponentially expanded through spiritual awareness and the translation of spiritual experience into lived positive cognition, behavioral habit, and practice. The editors of this volume help clear a rich new terrain for the next generation of humanitarian practitioners, researchers, and scholars.” -Lisa Miller, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University, Editor of Oxford University Press Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality, Author of The Awakened Brain and The Spiritual Child “At last! This broad-based, creative, integrative handbook helps fill a niche by focusing directly on the interface between positive psychology and the psychology of religion and spirituality.” -Julie J. Exline, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychological Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Co-Author of Working With Spiritual Struggles in Psychotherapy: From Research to Practice. 0aPositive psychology. 0aPsychology and religion.14aPositive Psychology.24aPsychology of Religion and Spirituality.1 aDavis, Edward B.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aWorthington Jr., Everett L.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aSchnitker, Sarah A.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303110273808iPrinted edition:z978303110275208iPrinted edition:z978303110276940uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10274-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aZDB-2-SOB  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)07319nam a22005415i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001000172072001600182072002300198072001500221082001500236082001400251245017700265250001800442264007500460300006800535336002600603337002600629338003600655347002400691490005400715505289700769520235103666650002306017650005206040650002706092650002606119650002206145650002706167700008006194700007906274710003406353773002606387776003606413776003606449776003606485830005406521856004606575912001406621912001506635950006106650950006606711978-3-031-12600-0DE-He21320221125151112.0cr nn 008mamaa221125s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311260009978-3-031-12600-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-12600-02doi 4aRC455 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922304a362.222310aIntegrative Social Work Practice with Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Other Forcibly Displaced Personsh[electronic resource] /cedited by Nancy J.

Social workers are well positioned to serve coordinating and leadership roles in this interdisciplinary field due to their holistic training. This book weaves together micro, mezzo, and macro levels of practice into integrated social work practice. Its historical account of humanitarian emergencies, coverage of social work frameworks and principles, and review of existing best practices at the clinical, community, and policy levels ground the reader in a field of social work that requires consideration of historical frameworks alongside innovative responses to the complexity of humanitarian emergencies. The contributors incorporate best practices as well as address gaps in awareness, knowledge, and skills that they have observed and studied worldwide. Some of the topics explored include: Social Work with Displaced Children, Women, LGBTQI+, Asylum Seekers Return and Reintegration of Displaced Populations and Reconstruction in Post-conflict Societies Culture, Trauma, and Loss: Integrative Social Work Practice with Refugees and Asylum Seekers Clinical Social Work Practice with Forcibly Displaced Persons Grounded in Human Rights and Social Justice Principles Integrative Social Work Practice with Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Other Forcibly Displaced Persons is adoptable as a primary text for MSW and doctoral elective courses on global social work or international social work practice with persecuted and forcibly displaced people. This textbook is targeted to clinical social work or policy courses as well, and can be supplemental reading for required courses for migration and forced displacement majors. It is also useful for social workers or interdisciplinary practitioners working around the globe with displaced populations. “I wish this work had been available during past initiatives spearheaded by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. It would have positively impacted our endeavor to provide a wide range of services to our country's resettled refugees. This book needs to be read and integrated into practice by all who seek to ethically support refugees and other vulnerable populations.” Nguyen Van Hanh, Former Director, Office of Refugee Resettlement. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aEmigration and immigration—Government policy. 0aSocial work education.14aClinical Social Work.24aMigration Policy.24aSocial Work Education.1 aMurakami, Nancy J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aAkilova, Mashura.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303112599708iPrinted edition:z978303112601708iPrinted edition:z9783031126024 0aEssential Clinical Social Work Series,x2520-161140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-12600-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05242nam a22006135i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245011100248250001800359264007500377300006500452336002600517337002600543338003600569347002400605505212700629506001602756520093602772650001603708650003903724650001503763650002303778650001403801650002903815650004003844650006003884650001503944650002303959650001403982650002903996700007704025700007304102700006904175710003404244773002604278776003604304776003604340776003604376856004604412912001404458912001504472912001404487950006104501950006604562978-3-031-09687-7DE-He21320221126221825.0cr nn 008mamaa221126s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830310968779978-3-031-09687-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-09687-72doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aAI in Learning: Designing the Futureh[electronic resource] /cedited by Hannele Niemi, Roy D.

AI can support well-being initiatives and lifelong learning but educational institutions and companies need to take the changing technology into account. Moving towards AI supported by digital tools requires a dramatic shift in the concept of learning, expertise and the businesses built off of it. Based on the latest research on AI and how it is changing learning and education, this book will focus on the enormous opportunities to expand educational settings with AI for learning in and beyond the traditional classroom. This open access book also introduces ethical challenges related to learning and education, while connecting human learning and machine learning. This book will be of use to a variety of readers, including researchers, AI users, companies and policy makers. 0aPsychology. 0aSocial sciences—Data processing. 0aEducation. 0aCognitive science. 0aTeaching. 0aArtificial intelligence.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aComputer Application in Social and Behavioral Sciences.24aEducation.24aCognitive Science.24aPedagogy.24aArtificial Intelligence.1 aNiemi, Hannele.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aPea, Roy D.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aLu, Yu.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303109686008iPrinted edition:z978303109688408iPrinted edition:z978303109689140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-09687-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aZDB-2-SOB  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04564nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001900172072001600191072002300207072001500230082001500245245015300260250001800413264007500431300003300506336002600539337002600565338003600591347002400627490004300651505103200694520147801726650002503204650001903229650002603248650002203274650001603296650002503312650001903337650004503356650001603401700007903417700008903496710003403585773002603619776003603645776003603681776003603717830004303753856004603796912001403842912001503856950006103871950006603932978-3-031-13029-8DE-He21320221129071151.0cr nn 008mamaa221129s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311302989978-3-031-13029-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-13029-82doi 4aRC466.8-467.97 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922310aPrevention and Early Treatment of Depression Through the Life Courseh[electronic resource] /cedited by Vania Martínez, Claudia Miranda-Castillo	.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aVI, 206 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aDepression and Personality,x2662-35950 aChapter 1.

Special attention has been dedicated to facilitating factors for the development of health system capacity and the effectiveness of the different types of interventions. The first part of the book reviews the innovations in global prevention and non-pharmacological treatments for children, adolescents, and youths. The second part reviews interventions for adults across the lifespan, including older adults and caregivers. Despite the efforts to tackle depression, the COVID-19 pandemic directly or indirectly affected the mental health of the population, including an increase in the incidence of depressive disorders, which are underdiagnosed and undertreated in young and older people. Because of the characteristics of adolescence and older adulthood, people can consider depression signs and symptoms as natural, neglecting a proper diagnosis. To address these challenges in the clinical management of depression, Prevention and Early Treatment of Depression Through the Life Course presents a life course perspective on the analysis and treatment of depression to help clinical psychologists, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals understand the mechanisms associated with the onset of depression and identify/develop proper evidence-based treatments for different ages and in different circumstances. 0aClinical psychology. 0aMental health. 0aMedicine, Preventive. 0aHealth promotion. 0aPsychiatry.14aClinical Psychology.24aMental Health.24aHealth Promotion and Disease Prevention.24aPsychiatry.1 aMartínez, Vania.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aMiranda-Castillo	, Claudia.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303113028108iPrinted edition:z978303113030408iPrinted edition:z9783031130311 0aDepression and Personality,x2662-359540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-13029-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06803nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245011900255250001800374264007500392300004400467336002600511337002600537338003600563347002400599505339200623520155904015650003005574650002305604650003005627650002605657650003805683700014105721700007705862710003405939773002605973776003605999776003606035776003606071856004606107912001406153912001506167950006106182950006606243978-3-031-14080-8DE-He21320221129105901.0cr nn 008mamaa221129s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311408089978-3-031-14080-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-14080-82doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aHandbook of Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disordersh[electronic resource] /cedited by Dean McKay, Eric A.

Integrative state-of-the-art models document the complex interplay of risk and protective factors and other variables contributing to normal and pathological development. New and updated chapters describe current refinements in assessment methods and offer the latest research findings from neuroscience. In addition, the Second Edition provides readers with a detailed review across the spectrum of salient topics, from the effects of early deprivation to the impact of puberty. As the field continues to shift from traditional symptom-based concepts of pathology to a contemporary, dynamic paradigm, the Second Edition addresses such key topics pertinent to childhood anxiety as: · Early childhood disorders, including failure to thrive and attachment disorders. · Aggression, ADHD, and other disruptive conditions. · Developmental models of depression, anxiety, self-injury/suicide, and OCD. · The autism spectrum and other chronic developmental disorders. · Child maltreatment and trauma disorders. The Handbook of Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders, Second Edition of the handbook is a discipline-defining, forward-looking, essential resource for researchers, clinicians, scientist-practitioners, and graduate students in such fields as developmental psychology, child and adolescent psychiatry, social work, child and school psychology, educational psychology, and pediatrics. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSocial psychiatry.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aClinical Social Work.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.1 aMcKay, Dean.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0003-1158-50431https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1158-50434edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aStorch, Eric A.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303114079208iPrinted edition:z978303114081508iPrinted edition:z978303114082240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14080-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03914nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050002100172072001600193072002300209072001500232082001400247100007800261245010000339250001800439264007600457300004100533336002600574337002600600338003600626347002400662490002700686505040100713520175301114650002802867650002602895650003202921650004002953650003102993650002303024710003403047773002603081776003603107776003603143830002703179856004603206912001403252912001503266950006103281950006603342978-3-658-39337-3DE-He21320221209134219.0cr nn 008mamaa221202s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836583933739978-3-658-39337-37 a10.1007/978-3-658-39337-32doi 4aHF5548.7-5548.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.72231 aTreier, Michael.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aCorporate Health Management 4.0 in the Digital Ageh[electronic resource] /cby Michael Treier.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aWiesbaden :bSpringer Fachmedien Wiesbaden :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aIX, 59 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aessentials,x2197-67160 aDemands of the agile working world -- Legitimation of digital health concepts in the world of work -- Transformation of classic health management to health management 4.0 - Toolbox D-BGM (further differentiation according to fields of action) -- Action guide for the integration of digital components in the BGM portfolio -- Conclusion: Benefits of digitalization in health and safety management.  aThe essentials discusses the possibilities of digital occupational health management (D-BGM), from health communication such as health portals to wearables and health apps to online coaching, with regard to the requirements of Work 4.0.

Humanitarian work psychology foregrounds people before profit, not wages before people. It resonates with the SDGs through the Decent Work Agenda, a policy program that stresses a number of humanitarian concerns: standards and rights at work, employment creation and enterprise development, social protection and social dialogue. These standards and forms of dialogue, from the living wage standard to new diplomacies for inclusive policy dialogue, appear and re-appear throughout the following chapters and sections in the book. The book synthesizes job characteristics models and psychology of working approaches with job evaluation techniques, poverty trap theory, diminishing marginal returns, work justice theory, the social psychology of equality and inequality, and a range of literatures on wellbeing that crisscross the social sciences. Highlights humanitarian work psychology Provides job evaluation techniques Emphasizes work justice theory. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aPersonality. 0aDifference (Psychology).14aWork and Organizational Psychology.24aPersonality and Differential Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303119300208iPrinted edition:z978303119302608iPrinted edition:z978303119303340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-19301-9  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03456nam a22005415i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100008000248245007300328250001800401264007500419300006600494336002600560337002600586338003600612347002400648505054400672520109001216650001602306650001402322650002602336650004102362650002302403650004002426650001302466650002602479650001602505650002302521710003402544773002602578776003602604776003602640776003602676856004602712912001402758912001502772950006102787950006602848978-3-031-21398-4DE-He21320221223074947.0cr nn 008mamaa221223s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312139849978-3-031-21398-47 a10.1007/978-3-031-21398-42doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aWhissell, Cynthia.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aEngaging with Emotionh[electronic resource] /cby Cynthia Whissell.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXIV, 255 p. 49 illus., 31 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1.

It is a learning tool rather than an encyclopaedic presentation of its topic. The writing style is personal, direct and accessible. Citations are employed, but always for specific purposes. Cited materials are made accessible whenever possible by the provision of URLs. Readers learn about emotion and its relationship to brain, body, cognition, memory, and appraisal. They are also introduced to the role of emotion in language and in the fine arts. Readers of Engaging with Emotion will likely be students within the first two years of university or college taking a related course, or those who are interested in learning more about emotion. This book is ideal for adaptation to an online course format as it includes exercises and learning guides. The book uses straightforward and helpful language and examples to avoid frustrating or confusing students, but instead to keep them actively involved with the material in the book, and to help motivated learners learn. 0aPsychology. 0aEmotions. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aMotivation (Psychology) in children. 0aSocial psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aEmotion.24aCognitive Psychology.24aMotivation.24aSocial Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303121397708iPrinted edition:z978303121399108iPrinted edition:z978303121400440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-21398-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04844nam a22004695i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050002100172072001600193072002300209072001500232082001400247100009200261245016900353250001800522264008200540300005300622336002600675337002600701338003600727347002400763505033700787520273701124650002803861650001603889650004003905650001603945700007903961710003404040773002604074776003604100776003604136856004604172912001404218912001504232950006104247950006604308978-3-662-65339-5DE-He21320221224163152.0cr nn 008mamaa221224s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836626533959978-3-662-65339-57 a10.1007/978-3-662-65339-52doi 4aHF5548.7-5548.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.72231 aSchüler-Lubienetzki, Heidrun.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aDifficult People at Workh[electronic resource] :bAction Strategies for Dealing with Challenging Personalities /cby Heidrun Schüler-Lubienetzki, Ulf Lubienetzki.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aIX, 146 p. 27 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aToxic?! - To the point at the beginning -- Creeping poison - when the workplace slowly but surely becomes hell -- Toxic - What drives him?

This book helps professionals deal with difficult or even dangerous colleagues, employees or superiors - so-called "toxic people". Such people poison the work atmosphere, make life difficult for others, and cost their companies a lot of money. Some of these people are psychologically conspicuous; we are then often dealing with narcissists or psychopaths. In most cases, however, the destructive behavior is not (yet) based on a mental disorder. This book helps both those affected and those responsible in companies and organizations to recognize toxic people, to protect themselves and others from them, and to take promising action against them. This book is a translation of the original German 2nd edition Schwierige Menschen am Arbeitsplat by Heidrun Schüler-Lubienetzki and Ulf Lubienetzki, published by Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature in 2017. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation. Springer Nature works continuously to further the development of tools for the production of books and on the related technologies to support the authors. The Contents Diagnosis - characteristics and action patterns of toxic people Prevention and therapy - basic action strategies Psychological basics - motives and drivers of the toxic person Models - The toxic process and the costs for companies and affected persons Practice - Authentic examples and proven help The Target Groups Managers and affected persons as well as personnel developers, trainers, consultants and coaches in companies and organizations The Authors Graduate psychologist Heidrun Schüler-Lubienetzki and graduate engineer Ulf Lubienetzki work as coaches, trainers and consultants with a wide variety of companies and organizations. An important part of their work is to develop action strategies for dealing with toxic people together with those affected. In more than two decades, Heidrun Schüler-Lubienetzki has worked with several thousand professionals and managers. Ulf Lubienetzki has been working as a management consultant since 1998 and has many years of experience as a manager as well as the personnel manager of a consulting company. This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com).

Critical thinking is particularly important in bridging thinking divisions and its applicability across sciences, particularly medical sciences. We see critical thinking as educable and the arts as means to achieve this purpose. We address the multidimensional relationship between thinking and health and related mechanisms. Thinking mainly affects emotion regulation and executive function; in other words, both mental and physical health are related as a function of thoughts. Considering the thinking‐feeling‐emotion regulation/executive function pathway, it would be reasonable to propose thinking capacities‐based interventions to impact emotion regulation and executive function, such as mindfulness and psychotherapy. We review decision-making taking place in integrated and social contexts and discuss the decision-making styles-decision outcomes relation. Finally, artificial thinking and intelligence prepare us for decision-making outside the human mind. 0aNeurosciences. 0aPhilosophy of mind. 0aMental health. 0aCognitive neuroscience. 0aCognitive science.14aNeuroscience.24aPhilosophy of Mind.24aMental Health.24aCognitive Neuroscience.24aCognitive Science.1 aRezaei, Nima.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-3836-18271https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3836-18274edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303115958908iPrinted edition:z978303115960208iPrinted edition:z9783031159619 0aIntegrated Science,x2662-947X ;v1240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-15959-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03644nam a22004815i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007600248245007300324250001800397264008200415300004100497336002600538337002600564338003600590347002400626505083600650520119701486650001602683650001602699650002302715650004002738650002702778650002302805710003402828773002602862776003602888776003602924856004602960912001403006912001503020950006103035950006603096978-3-662-66393-6DE-He21320230104080406.0cr nn 008mamaa230104s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836626639369978-3-662-66393-67 a10.1007/978-3-662-66393-62doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aStauss, Bernd.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aPsychology of Gift-Givingh[electronic resource] /cby Bernd Stauss.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aX, 180 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aGift giving: joy, duty and frustration -- Gift and counter-gift: the reciprocity rule -- The valuation of the gift: the recipient decides, not the giver -- The financial value of the gift: can't buy me love?- The emotional value of the gift: empathy, surprise, sacrifice -- Gifts as information media: what they say about the giver and the relationship with the recipient -- Gifts in romantic relationships: what enhances and what weakens the relationship?- Gifts to different recipients: who gets anything at all and how much?- Difficult givers and recipients: risk reduction strategies -- Cash gifts and vouchers: when are they taboo and when are they welcome?- Handling over and receiving the gift: the moment of truth -- Gifts and gender: Santa Claus is a woman -- Gifts and culture: what applies globally and what regionally?.  a Gift-giving is an economically significant area of consumer behavior. For we are constantly buy gifts: for Christmas and Mother’s Day, for birth and baptism, for the start of school and exams, for engagements and weddings, for birthdays or as souvenirs. Moreover, gift-giving is a very important psychological phenomenon, based on voluntariness, but also representing a duty and requiring compliance with rules. Thus, gift giving is by no means always associated with joy, but also with stress in the search for a perfect gift and disappointment when gifts fail. The book presents central results of psychological research on gift-giving. These provide answers to the following questions, among others: What ‘secret’ rules of giving and receiving do we follow? What messages do we send with our gifts? How do certain characteristics - such as the amount of the price or empathy - influence satisfaction with a gift? What mistakes should we avoid when giving gifts in romantic relationships? When is a monetary gift appropriate and when is it not? The Author Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. em. Bernd Stauss held the Chair of Service Management at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. . 0aPsychology. 0aCounseling. 0aSocial psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCounseling Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978366266392908iPrinted edition:z978366266394340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-66393-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)07473nam a22004695i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100008400248245013600332250001800468264007500486300006300561336002600624337002600650338003600676347002400712505330200736520247704038650001606515650002206531650004006553650004006593710003406633773002606667776003606693776003606729776003606765856004606801912001406847912001506861950006106876950006606937978-3-031-18583-0DE-He21320230109155323.0cr nn 008mamaa230109s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311858309978-3-031-18583-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-18583-02doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aMcKinley, Catherine E.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aUnderstanding Indigenous Gender Relations and Violenceh[electronic resource] :bBecoming Gender AWAke /cby Catherine E.

Gender and racial-based inequities span from the home life to Indigenous women’s wellness—including physical, mental, and social health. The conundrum of how and why Indigenous women—many of whom historically held respected and even held sacred status in many matrilineal and female-centered communities—now experience the highest rates of gendered-based violence is focal to this work. Unlike Western European and colonial contexts, Indigenous societies tended to be organized in fundamentally distinct ways that were woman-centered and where gender roles and values were reportedly more egalitarian, fluid, flexible, inclusive, complementary, and harmonious. Understanding how Indigenous gender relations were targeted as a tool of patriarchal settler colonization and how this relates to women more broadly can be a key to unlocking gender liberation—a catalyst for readers to become ‘gender AWAke.’ Living gender AWAke encompasses living in alignment with agility (AWA), with clear awareness of how gender and other sociostructural factors affect daily life, as well as how to navigate such factors. To live in alignment, is to live from ones’ center and in accordance with one’s authentic self, with agility, by nimbly responding to life’s constantly shifting situations. This empirically-grounded work extends and deepens the Indigenist framework of historical oppression, resilience, and transcendence (FHORT) by delving deep into the resilience, transcendence, and wellness components of FHORT while centering gender. Understanding the changing gender roles for Indigenous peoples over time fosters decolonization more broadly by enabling greater understanding of how sexism and misogyny hurt people across personal and political spheres. This understanding can foster the process of becoming gender AWAke by identifying and dismantling of sexism and by becoming decolonized from prescriptive gender roles that inhibit living in alignment with one’s true or authentic self. Readers will gain: a research-based approach linking historical oppression, gender-based inequities, and violence against Indigenous women understanding of how patriarchal colonialism undermines all genders a tool to dismantle sexism more broadly pathways to become gender AWAke through the understanding of Indigenous women's resilience and transcendence. 0aPsychology. 0aSex (Psychology).14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aPsychology of Gender and Sexuality.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303118582308iPrinted edition:z978303118584708iPrinted edition:z978303118585440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-18583-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04195nam a22005415i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201072001500224082001500239245012500254250001800379264007500397300006500472336002600537337002600563338003600589347002400625490004200649505097400691520118601665650002602851650002802877650001902905650002602924650004002950650001902990700007503009700007803084700007903162710003403241773002603275776003603301776003603337776003603373830004203409856004603451912001403497912001503511950006103526950006603587978-3-030-84942-9DE-He21320230116155715.0cr nn 008mamaa230116s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830308494299978-3-030-84942-97 a10.1007/978-3-030-84942-92doi 4aRA790.55 7aJMH2bicssc 7aPSY0310002bisacsh 7aJMH2thema04a155.9422310aZoos and Aquariums in the Public Mindh[electronic resource] /cedited by John Fraser, Joe E.

Future Directions and Interventions in the Psychology of Learning Disorders in Children and Adolescents.  aThis book addresses the need to view specific learning disorders (SLDs) within a mental health framework, as supported by their placement alongside autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). It describes how policy and practice point to a different perspective – specifically that SLDs are often treated as educational rather than psychological problems – and examines the implications of this dichotomy. The book reviews empirical research that suggests children need access to treatment for clinical components of SLDs that may respond to psychological intervention separately from, and in addition to, educational interventions. It provides a theoretical framework for organizing research findings and clinical perspectives that support understanding the clinical components of SLDs and addresses the need for a mental health framework within which to approach theory, treatment, and assessment of SLDs. Key areas of coverage include: Examining different theoretical orientations to learning disorders (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, neuropsychoeducational, psychoanalytic). Adapting evidence-based therapeutic techniques for use with children and adolescents who have learning disorders. The need for accurate and well characterized assessment of SLDs. How incorporating a cognitive neuroscience perspective into assessment can move LD treatment and research forward.

Guided by established psychological theory, these are embraced within a unifying framework centered around the concepts of responsibility and blame. A valuable contribution to the understanding of fundamental social issues." —Bernard Weiner, Distinguished Research Professor, University of California, Los Angeles Questions about the causes of events, from terrorist attacks to mass shootings to economic and public health crises dominate conversations across the US. Recent research in social psychology outlines the process we use to identify the causes of such events, reveals how we determine who is responsible or to blame, and documents the far-reaching consequences of these determinations for our emotions, our actions, and our attitudes. Current approaches to political opinions posit a direct path from a person’s worldview (liberal or conservative) to their attitudes toward specific political issues like abortion and welfare. This book argues that blame is the missing link between the two. Gail Sahar demonstrates that the current emphasis on value differences, whether between conservatives and liberals in the U.S. or between religious and secular countries on a global level, ignores commonalities in the way people think about issues. She proposes that focusing on perceived causes of social problems is a much more promising avenue for dialog than trying to reconcile fundamental belief systems. Informed by the latest psychological science, this new take on how to change attitudes has implications for anyone seeking to influence the viewpoints of others, from politicians and activists to ordinary people talking about current events at a dinner party. Gail Sahar is Jane Oxford Keiter Professor of Psychology, Wheaton College, Massachusetts USA. Professor Sahar has been researching the effects of causal perceptions on political attitudes for over 30 years. Her research focuses on the links between political ideology, perceptions of the causes of social problems, blame, emotions, and attitudes toward controversial social issues, such as poverty, abortion, and terrorism. 0aPolitical psychology. 0aAttitude (Psychology). 0aCommunication in politics. 0aAmerica—Politics and government. 0aEmotions.14aPolitical Psychology.24aAttitudes.24aPolitical Communication.24aAmerican Politics.24aEmotion.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303120235308iPrinted edition:z978303120237740uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20236-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03498nam a22005295i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100008200248245011100330250001800441264007500459300006400534336002600598337002600624338003600650347002400686490005600710505067300766520087301439650001602312650002302328650002102351650004002372650002302412650002102435700008602456710003402542773002602576776003602602776003602638776003602674830005602710856004602766912001402812912001502826950006102841950006602902978-3-031-24105-5DE-He21320230126175037.0cr nn 008mamaa230126s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312410559978-3-031-24105-57 a10.1007/978-3-031-24105-52doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aWasserman, Theodore.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aApraxia: The Neural Network Modelh[electronic resource] /cby Theodore Wasserman, Lori Drucker Wasserman.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIII, 218 p. 7 illus., 5 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aNeural Network Model: Applications and Implications0 aChapter 1.

Apraxia is currently understood as a motor speech disorder but an analysis of the neural network properties of apraxia indicate a more complex and far reaching disorder with implications for intentionality, motor coordination and motor control of response inhibition in a variety of human behavioral and emotional reactions. A thorough redefinition of apraxia will be provided along with suggestions for diagnoses and treatment. The primary audience will be diagnostic and treating professionals in a variety of disciplines (outlined above). Secondarily, the book will provide an argument and justification for considering developmental apraxia pf speech to be a separate and discrete white matter based disorder. Finally, this work will serve as a driver of future research in the area. 0aPsychology. 0aSocial psychology. 0aNeuropsychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.24aNeuropsychology.1 aWasserman, Lori Drucker.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124104808iPrinted edition:z978303124106208iPrinted edition:z9783031241079 0aNeural Network Model: Applications and Implications40uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24105-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05201nam a22006255i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245017800255250001800433264006900451300006500520336002600585337002600611338003600637347002400673490005800697505109800755520152601853650003003379650003903409650002603448650002303474650001903497650003203516650003003548650003103578650002603609650002603635650001903661650002103680700007803701700014503779700014303924700008004067710003404147773002604181776003604207776003604243776003604279830005804315856004604373912001404419912001504433950006104448950006604509978-3-031-22649-6DE-He21320230128074952.0cr nn 008mamaa230128s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312264969978-3-031-22649-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-22649-62doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aEnvironmental Impacts on Familiesh[electronic resource] :bChange, Challenge, and Adaptation /cedited by Selena E.

Families in Context: Understanding Environmental Impacts on Family Functioning in Service of Resilience and Equity.  aThis book examines ways in which families’ physical environments have implications for their relationships and the health and well-being of their members. Attention is given to three aspects of the physical environment—disasters, climate change, and the built environment—and the challenges these may create for families. Chapters describe particular considerations within each of these three physical environment challenges, the ways they affect families, and factors that protect families, promote their resilience and enable them to flourish. Finally, the volume offers recommendations for the role of government programs and policies to support families to overcome and/or adapt to environmental challenges as well as highlights the efficacy of evidence-based interventions aimed at promoting family resilience. Featured areas of coverage include: Extreme natural events and families’ postdisaster recovery. Family adaptations to climate change. The built environment and children’s health and well-being. Community-driven approaches to address environmental inequities. The urban environment of family caregiving.

The volume tackles how these demographic shifts compel scientists to consider the unique and universal processes that promote the growth, thriving, and resilience of these populations across this new landscape and also takes into account systems of oppression, power, privilege, racial justice, and structural disadvantage. It describes the challenges of conducting research with diverse populations and offers practical methodological solutions. The book provides an overview of the current demographic shifts and their implications for developmental researchers. It examines key diversity science constructs that need to be considered for all developmental research within this new global context in which societies are becoming more diverse. In particular, chapters address how to measure and conceptualize these constructs using within-group designs as well as research that includes youth from multiple backgrounds. In addition, the volume focuses on the contexts that shape the developmental trajectories of youth and how best to capture these contexts with an eye toward diversity science. Key areas of coverage include: Identifying best practices in the conceptualization and measurement of race and ethnicity in developmental science at the individual and contextual levels. Stimulating a dialogue that translates to an actionable agenda designed to tackle issues of conceptualization and measurement of key constructs associated with race/ethnicity. Leading-edge strategies for building interdisciplinary teams to conduct ethical and responsible work with diverse populations that include scholars of color. Finally, the book addresses translational work, including how the incorporation of diversity science can influence policy and help build collaborative research teams that are well-poised to conduct ethical research in these diverse populations. The volume provides recommendations for researchers to incorporate diversity science into their work. This book is a must-have resource for researchers, professors, clinicians, therapists and other professionals as well as graduate students in developmental, clinical child, and school psychology, public health, ethnic studies, counseling, anthropology, African American/Black Studies, Latinx/Latino/Chicano Studies, and Asian American Studies. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aPublic health. 0aRace. 0aEthnology. 0aSchool Psychology.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aPublic Health.24aRace and Ethnicity Studies.24aSociocultural Anthropology.24aSchool Psychology.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.1 aWitherspoon, Dawn P.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aStein, Gabriela Livas.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303123162908iPrinted edition:z978303123164308iPrinted edition:z978303123165040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-23163-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05581nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001700186072002300203072001600226082001400242245016200256250001800418264007500436300006500511336002600576337002600602338003600628347002400664505210800688520172702796650001904523650002104542650001704563650001804580650002104598650001504619700008304634710003404717773002604751776003604777776003604813776003604849856004604885912001404931912001504945950006104960950006605021978-3-031-14339-7DE-He21320230201034637.0cr nn 008mamaa230131s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311433979978-3-031-14339-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-14339-72doi 4aRC321-580 7aPSAN2bicssc 7aMED0570002bisacsh 7aPSAN2thema04a612.822310aEthics and Clinical Neuroinnovationh[electronic resource] :bFundamentals, Stakeholders, Case Studies, and Emerging Issues /cedited by Laura Weiss Roberts.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXII, 353 p. 22 illus., 16 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aSection 1: Fundamentals: the imperative for novel clinical therapeutics for mental disorders -- Chapter 1: The case for neuroinnovation: Health burdens associated with psychiatric, addiction-related, and co-occurring disorders -- Chapter 02: Neuroinnovation in medicine: History and future -- Chapter 03: Clinical neuroinnovation: Ethical frameworks and emerging issues -- Chapter 04: Changing contexts of neuroinnovation: Societal considerations -- Chapter 05: Changing contexts of neuroinnovation: Societal considerations -- Chapter 06: The NIH’s BRAIN2025 agenda: Attention to related ethical considerations -- Section 2: Special Topics in Clinical Neuroinnovation -- Chapter 07: In the surgical suite: Neurosurgery and neuroinnovation, and the ethics of neurostimulation for severe obesity -- Chapter 08: In the midst of uncertainty: Neuroinnovation at the edge of consciousness -- Chapter 09: On the edges: The ethics of human studies with psychedelic substances -- Chapter 10: In the courts: Emerging neuroscience technologies used for forensic purposes: ethical and legal implications -- Chapter 11: Into the wild: A comment on neuroethics startups - Moving from lab to society -- Section 3: Neuroethics and Innovation: Inquiry informed by the Roberts Valence Model -- Chapter 12: Introduction to our project: Understanding ethically-salient perspectives of diverse societal stakeholders in innovative neuroscience research on mental disorders -- Chapter 13: Qualitative phase: Codebook development -- Chapter 14: Qualitative findings: Diverse stakeholder perspectives on ethical considerations in innovative neuroscience research involving human volunteers -- Chapter 15: Qualitative findings: A focus on professional stakeholder perspectives on the environments and challenges of innovative neuroscience research -- Chapter 16: Qualitative findings: A focus on professional stakeholder perspectives on additional issues in research and clinical innovation in the brain -- Chapter 17: Pilot quantitative phase: Amazon MTurk as a novel approach to stakeholder-based neuroethics survey research.  aNew ways of understanding the brain – its nature, its capacities, its function, and its dysfunction – hold great promise for human wellbeing. Novel therapeutics spurred by this understanding have important roles addressing many clinical conditions, including Alzheimer Disease, depression, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This unique title explores a wide range of groundbreaking sciences and clinical practices for brain-based conditions, including deep brain stimulation, optogenetics, technology-delivered therapies, predictive testing, and new clinical uses of ketamine, cannabis, and other psychoactive substances. An introduction to the imperative to develop new treatments for devastating brain disorders and the state of current therapeutics in psychiatry, addiction, and behavioral disorders is presented, and chapters from leading physician-scientists and neuroethicists outline the clinical and the ethical issues arising in innovation and in the creation of new therapeutics for brain diseases. Written by renowned thought leaders in their fields, the book presents tightly written contributions on novel qualitative and quantitative data from stakeholders in the field, including neuroscientist-clinicians, people living with mental illness and/or addictions, and oversight/policy stakeholders. Concise, anticipatory, and centered on the principles governing human biomedical research and innovation in developing novel therapeutics for brain disorders, Ethics and Clinical Neuroinnovation will be of great value to clinicians, researchers, and students from a vast array of backgrounds, including neuroethics, neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy, entrepreneurship, and the law. 0aNeurosciences. 0aNeuropsychology. 0aNeurology .14aNeuroscience.24aNeuropsychology.24aNeurology.1 aRoberts, Laura Weiss.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303114338008iPrinted edition:z978303114340308iPrinted edition:z978303114341040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14339-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)08073nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001700188072002300205072001600228082001600244245018800260250001800448264007500466300006700541336002600608337002600634338003600660347002400696505434600720520169505066650002006761650003006781650004906811650003306860650003006893650002406923700008006947700007507027700008307102710003407185773002607219776003607245776003607281776003607317856004607353912001407399912001507413950006107428950006607489978-3-031-04504-2DE-He21320230203085557.0cr nn 008mamaa230203s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830310450429978-3-031-04504-27 a10.1007/978-3-031-04504-22doi 4aRC423-428.8 7aMMZL2bicssc 7aMED0070002bisacsh 7aMKZL2thema04a616.85522310aHandbook of Speech-Language Therapy in Sub-Saharan Africah[electronic resource] :bIntegrating Research and Practice /cedited by Ulrike M.

Using an implementation science framework grounded in systems/organizational consultation research, the volume details how school reform or improvement may be facilitated. School-based case studies illustrate the application of implementation science to systems change efforts in schools and districts across the United States. Each case study describes the implementation science steps taken to deliver a school-based innovation at the systems level. The book discusses implementation science theory combined with real-world examples of its use in planning for, implementing, and engaging in ongoing evaluation of a systems change effort. Key areas of coverage include: Implementation science in educational settings. Key stakeholder roles in school-based systems change. Implementing and evaluating systems change in schools.

The increasing volume of scientific research on hypnosis and its clinical applications to treat health conditions such as pain, anxiety, trauma and depression has renewed the interest for this kind of practice in different disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, dentistry and nursing. As a result of this growing interest, there is an increasing number of spaces occupied by hypnosis in universities of different countries compared to what occurred in recent decades. Nevertheless, what this means, at various levels, is still far from being deciphered, due to the absence of more detailed research and surveys involving a larger number of institutions, students, faculty and research groups. This volume intends to shed a new light into the discussions about the growing presence of hypnosis in academia by bringing together contributions of practitioners and researchers working with hypnosis in academic settings in ten countries from different parts of the world: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, France, Hungary, Israel, Portugal, Russia and Switzerland. The discussions presented in these contributions revolve around four axes of analysis: the historical trajectory of hypnosis within academic institutions; the epistemological nature of hypnosis and its relationships with other fields of knowledge; the importance of scientific research for the current development of hypnosis and its clinical applications; and how teaching and training in hypnosis is organized in universities today, with its ethical and legal implications in different cultural contexts. Hypnosis in Academia: Contemporary Challenges in Research, Healthcare and Education will be a great resource for both researchers and practitioners working with hypnosis, and a valuable source of information for human and social scientists in general interested in understanding how a once discredited practice regained respect from the academic community and is now a growing topic of interest for scholars and clinicians all around the world. 0aClinical psychology. 0aClinical health psychology. 0aMedical education.14aClinical Psychology.24aHealth Psychology.24aMedical Education.1 aNeubern, Maurício S.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aBioy, Antoine.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303122874208iPrinted edition:z978303122876608iPrinted edition:z978303122877340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-22875-9  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03550nam a22004815i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001400242100007800256245012000334250001800454264007600472300004200548336002600590337002600616338003600642347002400678490002700702505029100729520160101020650002102621650002502642650002102667650001902688710003402707773002602741776003602767776003602803830002702839856004602866912001402912912001502926950006102941950006603002978-3-658-39800-2DE-He21320230221012559.0cr nn 008mamaa230209s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836583980029978-3-658-39800-27 a10.1007/978-3-658-39800-22doi 4aQP360-360.7 7aJMM2bicssc 7aPSY0200002bisacsh 7aJMM2thema04a612.82231 aVölzke, Volker.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aPatients with Memory Disordersh[electronic resource] :bAn Introduction for Psychotherapists /cby Volker Völzke.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aWiesbaden :bSpringer Fachmedien Wiesbaden :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXII, 58 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aessentials,x2197-67160 aMemory functions and systems -- Learning and memory as a temporal process -- Learning and memory across the lifespan -- Factors that negatively influence learning and memory -- Acquired brain damage -- Types of dementia -- Diagnosis and assessment -- Principles of exercise and therapy.  aMemory disorders in everyday life impair the quality of life of those affected and also have an impact on the therapeutic approach.

Creativity is analyzed through the lens of cultural psychology, in which psychological processes emerge over the course of life, and can only be understood in relation to the subject’s history and life experiences. Dialogism is presented as central for the constitutive dynamics of the developing subject and the emergence of creative actions through the expression of human agency. The authors highlight Bakhtinian dialogism and its developments in the scientific field of psychology and related areas to shed new light on creativity and its processes. The authors argue this will enable a better understanding of creativity in its development and emergence, and its impact on individuals and society.

The book includes a comprehensive analysis of what growth implies within midlife and older age and considers how different developmental areas are intertwined (i.e., physical, cognitive, social and emotional development as well as personality growth). As the gap between theory and practice still constitutes an issue in developmental research, the handbook also aims to provide illustrative examples of prevention and intervention from a positive psychology perspective. These were selected to represent a variety of topics, relevant for individual development where research informs practice, ranging from happiness, grandparenthood, love and sexuality to loneliness, depression, anxiety, suicide prevention and coping with death. This handbook is a must-have resource for students and researchers working in developmental psychology, health psychology, gerontology and, public health. It will also be of interest to practitioners such as counsellors, life coaches, psychotherapists, organizational psychologists, health professionals, social workers or public health planners. 0aPsychology. 0aPositive psychology. 0aClinical health psychology. 0aGerontology. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aAge distribution (Demography).14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aPositive Psychology.24aHealth Psychology.24aGerontology.24aDevelopmental Psychology.24aAging Population.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124448308iPrinted edition:z978303124450608iPrinted edition:z978303124451340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24449-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04670nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001700184072002300201072001600224082001600240245016200256250001800418264007500436300006600511336002600577337002600603338003600629347002400665505154400689520113502233650003603368650003203404650002203436650002303458700007803481700007603559700008003635700007903715710003403794773002603828776003603854776003603890776003603926856004603962912001404008912001504022950006104037950006604098978-3-031-03921-8DE-He21320230225110620.0cr nn 008mamaa230225s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830310392189978-3-031-03921-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-03921-82doi 4aGV706.4 7aWSDP2bicssc 7aSPO0000002bisacsh 7aSCGP2thema04a796.01922310aSport and Exercise Psychologyh[electronic resource] :bTheory and Application /cedited by Julia Schüler, Mirko Wegner, Henning Plessner, Robert C.

The book is divided into two main parts: Theory and Application. The first part covers the theoretical facets of sport and exercise psychology, and the close link between theory and practice, divided into the sub-disciplines of psychology (cognition, motivation, emotion, personality and development, and social processes). The second part focuses on the applications of sport and exercise psychology in the context of performance and health. With contributions from scholars across the globe, the book offers an international and timely perspective on the key fundaments of sport psychology. Taken together, these chapters provide a challenging yet accessible overview of the larger field of sport and exercise psychology. This book is suitable for readers at different levels of competence, supported with didactic elements (learning objectives and learning control questions) to find the right learning level. 0aSports—Psychological aspects. 0aClinical health psychology.14aSport Psychology.24aHealth Psychology.1 aSchüler, Julia.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aWegner, Mirko.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aPlessner, Henning.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aEklund, Robert C.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303103920108iPrinted edition:z978303103922508iPrinted edition:z978303103923240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-03921-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03010nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001600190072002300206072001500229082001200244100007900256245010600335250001800441264007500459300006200534336002600596337002600622338003600648347002400684490003800708505052900746520062401275650001701899650003401916650002601950650001701976650002301993650002602016700007802042710003402120773002602154776003602180776003602216830003802252856004602290912001402336912001502350950006102365950006602426978-3-031-22839-1DE-He21320230227140237.0cr nn 008mamaa230227s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312283919978-3-031-22839-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-22839-12doi 4aHV6001-7220.5 7aJKV2bicssc 7aSOC0040002bisacsh 7aJKV2thema04a3642231 aKubrin, Charis E.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aImmigration and Crimeh[electronic resource] :bTaking Stock /cby Charis E.

From the research findings, the author derives the following questions: Are Burnout and Organisational Burnout in truth Double Bind-induced work-attachment- and work-relationship-disorders? Do Double Bind and the thereon based relationship disorders fuel the increasing loss of values and thus the self-destruction of the global Double Bind-Society?

Pictorial models will guide the reader into the multi-layered landscape of the soul and its principles. Along the way, the book decodes traumas as the soul’s fundamental building blocks and follows them back to their origins: existential limit-experiences and their common denominator, the splitting of the soul. The consequences of this autonomous survival mechanism affect all areas of life, starting from the unconscious. Therefore, they are not accessible by conventional methods working with the conscious mind. The presented integrative approach provides means and ways that significantly expand the potential of coaching. Content Trauma Work for a Stable Center in Life The Splitting Phenomenon and Its Consequences Methods and Their Interaction Practical Guidelines Ten Real-Life Case Studies Target Groups Coaches, HR Experts, Management Consultants, Executives, Entrepreneurs, Psychologists, Psychotherapists, Physicians, Alternative Practitioners About the Authors Alexander N. Riechers works as an executive coach for international companies and in his private practice. His goal ist to unleash the vital forces of the unconscious to support sustainable leadership development and personal growth. Radim Ress has been engaged in the transgenerational scope of the unconscious for more than 20 years. His integrative methodology focuses on the traumatic experiences of the ancestors and their effects on later generations. 0aPsychological consultation. 0aCounseling. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aNeuropsychology.14aConsulting.24aCounseling Psychology.24aWork and Organizational Psychology.24aNeuropsychology.1 aRess, Radim.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978365839398408iPrinted edition:z978365839400440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-39399-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03568nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050000700172072001500179072002300194072001400217082001200231245018500243250001800428264007500446300006600521336002600587337002600613338003600639347002400675505052900699506001601228520101201244650002202256650001602278650001602294650001402310650002102324650004002345650001602385650001402401700008602415700008002501700008502581710003402666773002602700776003602726776003602762856004602798912001402844912001502858912001402873950006102887950006602948978-3-031-20010-6DE-He21320230307110344.0cr nn 008mamaa230307s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312001069978-3-031-20010-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-20010-62doi 4aR1 7aMB2bicssc 7aMED0000002bisacsh 7aMB2thema04a61022312aA Practical Guide on Behaviour Change Support for Self-Managing Chronic Diseaseh[electronic resource] /cedited by Mara Pereira Guerreiro, Isa Brito Félix, Marta Moreira Marques.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXVI, 122 p. 15 illus., 12 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1: Interprofessional learning outcomes-based curriculum to support behaviour change in persons self-managing chronic disease -- Chapter 2: Concepts and theories in behavior change to support chronic disease self-management -- Chapter 3: Identifying and assessing self-management behaviours -- Chapter 4: Implementing behaviour change strategies -- Chapter 5: Communication and person-centred behaviour change -- Chapter 6.

The new edition reviews the scientific literature that supports findings that stress-hardiness and resilience in all children leads to happier and healthier lives as well as improved functionality across the lifespan. In this edition, expert contributors examine resilience in relation to environmental stressors as phenomena in child and adolescent disorders and as a means toward positive adaptation into adulthood. The significantly expanded third edition includes new and significantly revised chapters that explore strategies for developing resilience in families, clinical practice, and educational settings as well as its nurturance in caregivers and teachers. Key areas of coverage include: Exploration of the four waves of resilience research. Resilience in gene-environment transactions. Resilience in boys and girls. Resilience in family processes.

Recovery and new perspectives.  aThis book realistically describes the experiences of people living with schizophrenia and their families, from the detection of the first symptoms until the development of treatments and strategies to cope with this unique human condition. Schizophrenia is a form of psychosis in which subjective aspects, such as hallucinatory and delusional phenomena, tend to distort the understanding of reality. Because psychotic states fluctuate in intensity over time, those affected literally live between reason and illusion. Between Reason and Illusion: Demystifying Schizophrenia is an invitation to understand what it means to develop schizophrenia and to live with it throughout one's life. And this is an invitation to all those who are in some way affected by this condition: those who live with it, family members, friends, health professionals, and everyone who want to have a non-stigmatized view of mental disorders and people who live with them. “Faced with psychosis, the person affected by the disease and the family are lost and go looking for alternative or spiritual help, which usually delays the beginning of treatment. Jorge, Cecília and Rodrigo had the courage to face a difficult theme and the happy idea of writing a book of an educational nature about schizophrenia. The book's originality lies in the fact that it was written taking into account the experience of the person with the disease and his or her family members in the face of this something new that has occurred in their lives”. - Dr. Itiro Shirakawa, Professor Emeritus of the Paulista Medical School of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP/EPM), Brazil. This book is a translation of an original Portuguese edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation. 0aMental health. 0aPsychiatry. 0aOccupational therapy.14aMental Health.24aPsychiatry.24aOccupational Therapy.1 aVillares, Cecília Cruz.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aBressan, Rodrigo Affonseca.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124555808iPrinted edition:z9783031245572 0aCopernicus Books          , Sparking Curiosity and Explaining the World,x2731-899040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24556-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04626nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172050001600185072001600201072002300217072001500240082001500255100007800270245016800348250001800516264008500534300003500619336002600654337002600680338003600706347002400742505043000766520220901196650002003405650001903425650002303444650001803467650001603485650002303501650001903524650002603543650001703569650002703586700007703613710003403690773002603724776003603750776003603786776003603822856004603858912001403904912001503918950006103933950006603994978-3-031-13138-7DE-He21320230610131632.0cr nn 008mamaa230312s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311313879978-3-031-13138-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-13138-72doi 4aRC552.T7 4aBF175.5.P75 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.892231 aTujague, Nicole.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aCultural Safety in Trauma-Informed Practice from a First Nations Perspectiveh[electronic resource] :bBillabongs of Knowledge /cby Nicole Tujague, Kelleigh Ryan.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXXIX, 287 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aDedication -- Preface -- Foreword -- Chapter 1 Introducing Billabongs of Knowledge -- Chapter 2 The Lay of the Land -- Chapter 3 The Journey Towards Cultural Safety -- Chapter 4 Yarning at the Campsite: Understanding Trauma -- Chapter 5 Sharing Trauma Knowledge: Types of Trauma -- Chapter 6 Yarning about Racial Trauma -- Chapter 7 Sharing Practice Knowledge -- Chapter 8 The Cost of Caring -- Chapter 9 Culture and Healing.  aThis book provides an accessible resource for conducting culturally safe and trauma-informed practice with First Nations’ peoples in Australia. Designed by and for Australian Indigenous peoples, it explores psychological trauma and healing, and the clinical and cultural implications of the impacts of colonization, through an Indigenous lens. The authors recognise trauma at the heart of all Indigenous disadvantage, and explore types of trauma in the context of Indigenous, collective cultures. The chapters take an Indigenous ‘Yarning’ approach to sharing knowledge, and encourage readers to challenge their unconscious, long-held beliefs and worldviews. Nicole Tujague and Kelleigh Ryan identify the differences between mainstream systems and more holistic Indigenous understandings of social and emotional health and wellbeing and outline a meaningful practice framework for practitioners. They analyse types of complex trauma, including intergenerational, institutional, collective and historical trauma; and discuss the impacts of racism and the concept of ‘cultural load’. They also address vicarious, or “compassion” trauma experienced by front line workers and carers; and offer insights into their experience of working with collective healing programs. This book is essential reading for Indigenous practitioners and service providers to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is also a valuable resource for students likely to work with First Nations’ peoples within a broad range of health and social science disciplines. Nicole Tujague is one of the two founding directors of The Seedling Group, a consultancy that offers training on cross-cultural safety and trauma-informed practice, particularly in First Nations contexts. She has a Bachelor of Indigenous Studies and is completing a PhD in Indigenous Evaluation Methodology from Australia’s Southern Cross University (SCU). Kelleigh Ryan is Director and Consulting Psychologist for The Seedling Group, a Fellow of the Australian Psychological Society and Vice Chair of the Australian Indigenous Psychologists Association. She completed her degree in psychology at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. 0aPsychic trauma. 0aMental health. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aMedical care. 0aCounseling.14aTrauma Psychology.24aMental Health.24aClinical Social Work.24aHealth Care.24aCounseling Psychology.1 aRyan, Kelleigh.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303113137008iPrinted edition:z978303113139408iPrinted edition:z978303113140040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-13138-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06724nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245017300255250001800428264007500446300004400521336002600565337002600591338003600617347002400653505264700677520191603324650003005240650003905270650002305309650001605332650001905348650003005367650003805397650003105435650002605466650001605492650001905508700008905527700008405616700007605700710003405776773002605810776003605836776003605872776003605908856004605944912001405990912001506004950006106019950006606080978-3-031-18377-5DE-He21320230314073100.0cr nn 008mamaa230314s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311837759978-3-031-18377-57 a10.1007/978-3-031-18377-52doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aHandbook of Mind/Body Integration in Child and Adolescent Developmenth[electronic resource] /cedited by J.

It discusses the interactions of emotions, experiences, thoughts in the mind – and their manifestations in the body – of children and youth. The book describes the effects of bodily conditions on the emotional state and mental functioning of children, such as cerebral palsy, major medical conditions, and other chronic health problems. It also explores the effects of chronic stress as well as child neglect and abuse on bodily manifestations. Key areas of coverage include: Developmental issues in the embodiment of self and body image in children and adolescents. Trauma and mind/body consequences in children and adolescents. Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Unexplained medical conditions, somatoform disorders, and conversion disorders during childhood and adolescence, including unexplained conditions in different organ systems (e.g., gastrointestinal, dermatological, neurological). Body/mind conditions in youth with physical and intellectual disabilities and chronic or severe medical conditions, including palliative care. Complementary and alternative treatment approaches to mind/body issues in children and adolescents, supplementing the usual mental health interventions. The Handbook of Mind/Body Integration in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry is an essential resource for researchers, professors, and graduate students as well as clinicians, therapists, and related professionals in developmental psychology, child and adolescent psychiatry, family therapy, social work, pediatrics, and public health. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSystemic therapy (Family therapy). 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aPediatrics. 0aPublic health.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.24aSystems or Family Therapy.24aClinical Social Work.24aPediatrics.24aPublic Health.1 aMaldonado-Duran, J.

Unlike other books which focus on the individual perspective of becoming a parent (especially for mothers), this book examines how couples and individuals successfully navigate this important life passage. This book covers a mix of psychological and sociological studies on the transition to parenthood. Readers will learn about the affective, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of this transition in early 21st century America and how it has changed in the past three decades. The book is aimed at graduate students, researchers and professionals who are interested in an interdisciplinary approach to this most formative passage in adult life. By bringing together past and current research, this book tells the story of becoming parents in 21st century America from his, her, and their points of view. Actor-partner interdependence model approach Affective, behavioral and cognitive processes Broad review of gender and the transition. 0aClinical psychology.14aClinical Psychology.1 aMarcussen, Kristen.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124154308iPrinted edition:z978303124156708iPrinted edition:z978303124157440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24155-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03130nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001500242100007700257245010000334250001800434264008500452300003300537336002600570337002600596338003600622347002400658490005900682505018800741520101200929650002201941650002901963650002501992650002302017650001902040650002202059650003502081650002502116650002302141650001902164710003402183773002602217776003602243776003602279830005902315856004602374912001402420912001502434950006102449950006602510978-3-031-21355-7DE-He21320230810180806.0cr nn 008mamaa230316s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312135579978-3-031-21355-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-21355-72doi 4aPN171.4-239 7aCBV2bicssc 7aLAN0050002bisacsh 7aCBV2thema04a808.022231 aGoodwin, Gavin.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aCreativity and Anxiety: Making, Meaning, Experienceh[electronic resource] /cby Gavin Goodwin.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aVII, 89 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aPalgrave Studies in Creativity and Culture,x2755-45110 aChapter 1: Definitions and Connections -- Chapter 2: Anxiety and the Creative Encounter: Rollo May Revisited -- Chapter 3: Winnicott’s Potential Space and the Anxiety of Authorship.  aAnxiety is perhaps the defining psychological malady of our age, whereas creativity is seen as an almost unassailable good, its importance heralded and promoted in a range of disciplines and domains. A number of diverse thinkers and researchers have tried to unpick the relationship between anxiety and creativity, and this short book explores and connects some of their ideas and findings. Drawing on psychoanalysis and neuroscience, existential psychology and mindfulness, literary studies and philosophy, this book places a range of different disciplines in dialogue. It explores how creativity and anxiety might impact one another, and argues for the importance of establishing a diverse and inclusive cultural space which everyone can draw from and contribute to.

Conclusions. .  aThe essay already published in Italian and Spanish, analyzes the role played by rationality in the history of social sciences, in order to propose a basically problematic interpretation of human action. In this perspective, various theories of rationality connected to the various attempts to provide an "interpretative perspective" useful for a more adequate understanding of individual organizational and institutional action are examined. For this purpose, the works of numerous classics are examined including Dahrendorf, Mannheim, Marx, Popper, Weber and, in a different perspective, the contributions of Habermas, Luhmann, Parsons and Schütz. A reflection is then proposed on the concrete theoretical perspectives opened by the criticisms of the theory of rational choice, taking into consideration the observations and proposals advanced by Antiseri, Boudon, Sen, Simon. The contributions of Ardigò, Alexander, Cesareo and Machiavelli and Pareto are studied in depth, regarding the "extra rational" and value dimension in human action. Furthermore, the perspectives outlined by Bauman, Beck, Sennett are analyzed, in order to get to deepen the “liquid rationality”, the Risikogesellshaft and the Risikoleben, but also the development of uncontrolled flexibility and the consequences on personal life. Finally, we wonder about the reasons for unexpected action and through the contribution of Nussbaum and Piketty on the strategic role played by ethics, rationality and skills in postmodern societies. The evolution of the concept of rationality is analyzed, starting from the dichotomy between holism and individualism; The problematic nature of the interpretation of human behaviour is discussed in the light of the contributions of many social scientists shifting the focus from a utilitarian to a value-oriented approach; It describes the increasingly complex and unpredictable scenario that determines an open future based on unexpected behaviour and actions. 0aPsychology. 0aPhilosophy of mind. 0aEthics. 0aAction theory. 0aPhilosophy. 0aCognitive science.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aMoral Psychology.24aAction Theory.24aPhilosophy.24aCognitive Science.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303126792508iPrinted edition:z978303126794908iPrinted edition:z9783031267956 0aTheory and History in the Human and Social Sciences,x2523-867140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-26793-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03408nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001600190072002300206072001500229082001200244100007400256245017400330250001800504264007500522300004500597336002600642337002600668338003600694347002400730490003800754505063100792520085601423650003402279650001702313650002302330650001702353700008102370700007902451710003402530773002602564776003602590776003602626830003802662856004602700912001402746912001502760950006102775950006602836978-3-031-27693-4DE-He21320230322084843.0cr nn 008mamaa230322s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312769349978-3-031-27693-47 a10.1007/978-3-031-27693-42doi 4aHV6001-7220.5 7aJKV2bicssc 7aSOC0040002bisacsh 7aJKV2thema04a3642231 aEck, John E.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aPlace Management and Crimeh[electronic resource] :bOwnership and Property Rights as a Source of Social Control /cby John E.

Forms of social control: formal, informal, management.  aThis brief describes the theory and evidence of a form of social control known as place management. Created by property owners, place management is an alternative to the two other domains of social control: formally created by the state and informally created by residents. It helps explain the high concentration of crime and disorder at a relatively small proportion of addresses and facilities. This volume examines the specifics of place management and extends it in three ways: to show how high crime places may radiate crime into their surroundings; to reveal networks of places that create crime hotspot spanning blocks; to demonstrate how networks of place managers influence crime throughout neighborhoods. Finally, it shows that the policy implications of place management extend far beyond the police and should include regulatory policies. 0aCrime—Sociological aspects. 0aCriminology.14aCrime and Society.24aCriminology.1 aLinning, Shannon J.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aHerold, Tamara D.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303127692708iPrinted edition:z9783031276941 0aSpringerBriefs in Crime and Place40uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27693-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05947nam a22005415i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001900172072001600191072002300207072001500230082001500245245011300260250001800373264007500391300006600466336002600532337002600558338003600584347002400620490004900644505242400693520148003117650002504597650002604622650001904648650002504667650004404692650001904736700008004755700007504835700007604910710003404986773002605020776003605046776003605082776003605118830004905154856004605203912001405249912001505263950006105278950006605339978-3-031-22348-8DE-He21320230323124641.0cr nn 008mamaa230323s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312234889978-3-031-22348-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-22348-82doi 4aRC466.8-467.97 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922310aHandbook of Self-Compassionh[electronic resource] /cedited by Amy Finlay-Jones, Karen Bluth, Kristin Neff.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXIII, 457 p. 17 illus., 7 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aMindfulness in Behavioral Health,x2195-95870 aSection 1.

Different understandings of trauma are at play here, which are sometimes blurred and usually have little relation to each other. In order to provide orientation in the discussion and to contribute to a reflected use of the concept of trauma in research and practice, this book presents central - clinical, psychosocial, transgenerational and collective - trauma concepts and demonstrates their significance in selected therapeutic, institutional, research and socio-political fields of practice by means of case studies. The content: Actuality of trauma History of the trauma discourse Clinical conception of trauma Psychosocial trauma understanding Transgenerational transmission Concepts of collective traumatization The target groups: Professionals in psychosocial and educational trauma work Students and lecturers of psychology, medicine and health sciences The authors: Phil C. Langer is Professor of Social Psychology and Social Psychiatry at the International Psychoanalytic University Berlin. Dymczyk is doing her PhD at Humboldt-University Berlin in the context of a discourse analysis on the transgenerational transmission of traumatization. Alina Brehm is a university assistant at the Institute for Educational Science at the University of Vienna. Joram Ronel is head physician for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy at the Barmelweid Clinic and in scientific cooperation with the Technical University Munich. This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation. 0aClinical psychology. 0aPsychotherapy   .14aClinical Psychology.24aPsychotherapy.1 aDymczyk, Adina.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aBrehm, Alina.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aRonel, Joram.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978365840483308iPrinted edition:z9783658404857 0aessentials,x2197-671640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-40484-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04334nam a22006255i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245012200248250001800370264007500388300006300463336002600526337002600552338003600578347002400614490005500638505056300693520144301256650001602699650002602715650002302741650002502764650002502789650001702814650002902831650004002860650002602900650002302926650002602949650002502975650004503000700007703045700007903122700008203201710003403283773002603317776003603343776003603379776003603415830005503451856004603506912001403552912001503566950006103581950006603642978-3-031-24426-1DE-He21320230825091931.0cr nn 008mamaa230325s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312442619978-3-031-24426-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-24426-12doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aAlcohol and Sexual Violenceh[electronic resource] /cedited by David DiLillo, Sarah J.

Closing Discussions.  aThis book provides a chronology of the 68th Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, which is focused on contemporary research knowledge about sexual violence and alcohol use. This book is more specific to dating and intimate partner sexual violence in young adult populations. The target audience is researchers, prevention agencies and policymakers within academia and military settings. Alcohol use has long been recognized as a major contributor to sexual assault, with an estimated 50% of sexual assaults in the U.S. involving drinking by the victim, perpetrator, or both. Beyond the usual harmful effects, alcohol-involved assaults are associated with unique sequelae for female victims, including increased self-blame, stigma, and greater alcohol use to cope. Moreover, heavier drinking on the part of the perpetrator is associated with more serious incidents of assault (e.g., involving physical force) that result in more severe outcomes for victims. The purpose of this Symposium on Motivation is to bring together a group of experts in the areas of alcohol and sexual aggression to articulate the causes, consequences, and mechanisms of alcohol-involved sexual assault. Speakers will talk about classic and contemporary research and theories on these issues using cutting-edge approaches (e.g., virtual reality, neuroscience, laboratory-based alcohol administration) from a variety of perspectives (perpetrators, victims, bystanders). 0aPsychology. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aSocial psychology. 0aForensic psychology. 0aClinical psychology. 0aPersonality. 0aDifference (Psychology).14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCognitive Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.24aForensic  Psychology.24aClinical Psychology.24aPersonality and Differential Psychology.1 aDiLillo, David.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aGervais, Sarah J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aMcChargue, Dennis E.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124425408iPrinted edition:z978303124427808iPrinted edition:z9783031244285 0aNebraska Symposium on Motivation,x2947-9479 ;v6840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24426-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04711nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001900172072001600191072002300207072001500230082001500245245017900260250001800439264007500457300006700532336002600599337002600625338003600651347002400687490004300711505125500754520153502009650002503544650003003569650001603599650002503615650002103640650004003661700007903701710003403780773002603814776003603840776003603876776003603912830004303948856004603991912001404037912001504051950006104066950006604127978-3-031-23650-1DE-He21320230328111935.0cr nn 008mamaa230328s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312365019978-3-031-23650-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-23650-12doi 4aRC466.8-467.97 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922310aInterpretational Processing Biases in Emotional Psychopathology h[electronic resource] :bFrom Experimental Investigation to Clinical Practice /cedited by Marcella L.

Post-traumatic stress disorder.  aThe primary aim of this book is to bridge the gap between lab-based and clinical research by disseminating the latest interdisciplinary scientific findings on interpretational processing biases in the context of emotional psychopathology. It is designed to help the practitioner by drawing explicit links between the basic science and implications for clinical practice. This enables an enhanced interaction between science and practice, strengthening bi-directional translational links, and the potential to produce more meaningful and significant advances in the treatment of emotional psychopathology. This in turn will facilitate an innovative step-change in the area of both research and clinical practice. The book focuses on cognitive processing biases that are common across a wide range of psychological disorders, meaning that the conclusions drawn have relevance across the whole spectrum of psychopathology and will stimulate and inspire a broad range of discussions and future work. From the foreword by Nikolaos Kazantzis: "The practice of CBT is complex and requires a tailored approach. Every technique has a specific target but may be used for multiple purposes simultaneously in support of the client’s therapeutic goals. The purpose of Dr. Woud’s book is to elucidate the ways in which interpretational biases can be a focus of intervention for CBT therapists at all stages of professional development, from those undertaking training to master clinicians. Dr. Woud has succeeded admirably in this regard.". 0aClinical psychology. 0aPsychology, Pathological. 0aPsychology.14aClinical Psychology.24aPsychopathology.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.1 aWoud, Marcella L.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303123649508iPrinted edition:z978303123651808iPrinted edition:z9783031236525 0aCBT: Science Into Practice,x2946-542740uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-23650-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03981nam a22006255i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172072001600183072002300199072001500222082001500237100007700252245018400329250001800513264006900531300003300600336002600633337002600659338003600685347002400721490005700745505037500802520107901177650002502256650002602281650001902307650002302326650002002349650002602369650002502395650001902420650002302439650002302462700007802485700007902563700007902642700008102721700007702802700008502879710003402964773002602998776003603024776003603060830005703096856004603153912001403199912001503213950006103228950006603289978-3-031-26883-0DE-He21320230330093751.0cr nn 008mamaa230330s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312688309978-3-031-26883-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-26883-02doi 4aRA1148 7aJMK2bicssc 7aPSY0140002bisacsh 7aJMK2thema04a614.152231 aBaker, Monty T.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aViolence in the Militaryh[electronic resource] /cby Monty T.

Clinical Implications, Limitations, Future Directions, and Conclusions.  aThis brief highlights issues relating to military service members’ expression of violence outside of the military due to the constant readiness for or the exposure to organized violence. It investigates how service members are affected by these experiences, considering both the exacerbation of aggressive traits and the impact it has on mental health.

Everyone has an opinion on it, but not a lot of clarity. Much has been written on the subject - biographies, autobiographies, technical books, popular science books, and practical manuals - but genius in all of its dimensions has yet to be addressed. This book seeks to remedy that. What follows is a work of significant breadth that hopes to facilitate a nuanced popular understanding of the definition of genius, examining all of the main theories and approaches regarding the nature and origin of brilliance, the cognitive path that geniuses follow, and the difference that exists between “geniuses” on one side and “normal people” on the other. Pragmatic indications surrounding this issue are also examined, regarding such questions as: is it possible to become a genius or is genius innate? If it is possible, what is the path – no doubt long and difficult – that one must take? Is there a method for becoming a genius that can be taught and learned? This book will appeal to anyone who has ever contemplated great ideas and works and wondered how they came into being. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aScience—History. 0aScience—Philosophy. 0aIntellect. 0aArtificial intelligence.14aCognitive Psychology.24aHistory of Science.24aPhilosophy of Science.24aIntelligence.24aArtificial Intelligence.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303127091808iPrinted edition:z9783031270932 0aPopular Science,x2626-612140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27092-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03281nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007800248245012600326250001800452264007500470300004100545336002600586337002600612338003600638347002400674505022600698520113700924650001602061650002302077650002902100650002602129650001602155650002102171650004002192650002302232650002902255650002602284650001602310650001902326710003402345773002602379776003602405776003602441776003602477856004602513912001402559912001502573950006102588950006602649978-3-031-24012-6DE-He21320230406163044.0cr nn 008mamaa230406s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312401269978-3-031-24012-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-24012-62doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aEdelman, Shimon.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Consciousness Revolutionsh[electronic resource] :bFrom Amoeba Awareness to Human Emancipation /cby Shimon Edelman.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aX, 226 p. 2 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aPart I The Human Condition -- 1 Selfless Consciousness -- 2 Minimal Selves -- 3 Self-consciousness -- 4 Speech and Sign -- 5 Self and Society -- Part II The Roads To Freedom -- 6 Self-care -- 7 A World to Win -- Epilogue.  aThis book is about all things consciousness, great and small. It starts by pointing to the key characteristic of consciousness, without realizing which it cannot be understood: like everything else about the mind, it is fundamentally a kind of computation. Among many other matters, this explains: how it is that we share some aspects of consciousness with bacteria; how it can arise in artificial machines and not just living ones; how the empty cocoon of the self that it spins ends up pretending to be the butterfly; and how consciousness dooms this virtual butterfly to the splendor and the suffering of being awake and aware. Unlike most other books on consciousness, this one includes a discussion of some possible ways whereby we, pinned like butterflies by our species’ history and socioeconomic circumstances, can awake to our collective predicament and join forces to do something about it. It should be of interest to all readers who care about the nature of our lived experience — and about our survival, which depends on developing critical consciousness of our dire situation and the social dynamics that shape it. 0aPsychology. 0aCognitive science. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aPhilosophy. 0aPhenomenology .14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCognitive Science.24aArtificial Intelligence.24aCognitive Psychology.24aPhilosophy.24aPhenomenology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124011908iPrinted edition:z978303124013308iPrinted edition:z978303124014040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24012-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04720nam a22005895i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172050001600190072001700206072002300223072001600246082001500262100007700277245012700354250001800481264008500499300003500584336002600619337002600645338003600671347002400707505081400731520180401545650004203349650002503391650003003416650002303446650002503469650002803494650003003522650002503552650003303577650002303610650002503633650002803658700007403686710003403760773002603794776003603820776003603856776003603892856004603928912001403974912001503988950006104003950006604064978-3-031-14965-8DE-He21320230408211752.0cr nn 008mamaa230408s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311496589978-3-031-14965-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-14965-82doi 4aLC4001-4700.4 4aLC4812-4827 7aJNSC2bicssc 7aEDU0000002bisacsh 7aJNSC2thema04a371.912231 aMiller, Erez C.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aSelf-Efficacy and Success: Narratives of Adults with Disabilitiesh[electronic resource] /cby Erez C.

Growing up, the people surrounding them and environmental conditions helped them develop their self-efficacy. The book is divided into four parts. It begins by discussing the elusive essence of success, especially for people with disabilities. The authors then discuss selfefficacy, and how it pertains to occupations of people with disabilities. Part two (school years) and part three (higher education) address some of the challenges experienced by students with disabilities. It shows how parents and educational figures helped them enhance their self-efficacy. Part two also discusses current and future trends in inclusive education, and recommendations for practitioners. Part three pays attention to some of the unique traits that helped them overcome obstacles. Finally, the authors focus on employment of people with disabilities and explore some of the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic in light of this. It includes messages of hope to parents, professionals and individuals with disabilities. Erez C. Miller is a senior lecturer at Achva Academic College in Israel. He works with children with disabilities and their families as a licensed school psychologist. He published several articles on the narratives of adults with disabilities, and on the self-efficacy of teachers and adults with disabilities. Efrat Kass is an expert in the domains of teachers’ self-efficacy, teacher training, and bibliotherapy. She has published three books (in Hebrew) and many articles and has presented her scientific work at many conferences around the world. She is married, a mother, grandmother, and an artist. 0aPeople with disabilities—Education. 0aInclusive education. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSocial psychology. 0aPositive psychology. 0aEducational psychology.14aEducation and Disability.24aInclusive Education.24aDevelopment across Lifespan.24aSocial Psychology.24aPositive Psychology.24aEducational Psychology.1 aKass, Efrat.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303114964108iPrinted edition:z978303114966508iPrinted edition:z978303114967240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14965-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03563nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245013000248250001800378264007500396300003400471336002600505337002600531338003600557347002400593505066200617520093301279650001602212650003202228650001902260650002502279650002002304650001302324650004002337650002302377650001902400650002502419650002002444650001302464700015002477710003402627773002602661776003602687776003602723776003602759856004602795912001402841912001502855950006102870950006602931978-3-031-26200-5DE-He21320230408114542.0cr nn 008mamaa230408s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312620059978-3-031-26200-57 a10.1007/978-3-031-26200-52doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aCovid-19: Health Disparities and Ethical Challenges Across the Globeh[electronic resource] /cedited by H.

Each contributor has a background in public health, applied psychology, and international issues, bringing a unique perspective and a valuable lens through which to view these issues. Additionally, the authors are members of the COVID-19 Ethics and Legal Issues Task Force within Division 52 (International Psychology) of the American Psychological Association. The task force has spent the last two years describing how COVID-19 has highlighted pre-existing health disparities within the U.S. and internationally.

This book identifies behavioural business as a powerful application of the latest insights and tools from psychology and behavioural science to decision-making in business, management and policy. This book uniquely positions behavioural business as diﬀerent from both behavioural economics and psychology. This book instead applies a fresh focus on behavioural interventions in policy and business. This book introduces this new area and showcases what it contributes to a number of important contemporary business and policy issues. These include behavioural insights for managers in diverse and multi-cultural workplaces, designers of organisations, interventions, products and services, ﬁnancial advisors, public policy makers, business creatives and entrepreneurs as well as charity and NGO practitioners. This book summarises state-of-the-art knowledge in the areas of expertise of the authors, who are members of the Behavioural Business Lab at RMIT University in Australia. This book will interest advanced students in related subjects as well as academics and policy makers hoping to learn and apply behavioural insights to their areas of expertise. . 0aEconomics—Psychological aspects. 0aEconomics. 0aCulture. 0aBusiness. 0aManagement science. 0aBusiness enterprises—Finance.14aBehavioral Economics.24aBehavioral Finance.24aCultural Economics.24aEconomic Psychology.24aBusiness and Management.24aCorporate Finance.1 aBlijlevens, Janneke.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aElkins, Meg.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aNeelim, Ananta.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981195545708iPrinted edition:z978981195547108iPrinted edition:z978981195548840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-5546-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03583nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007500248245014700323250001800470264006900488300006200557336002600619337002600645338003600671347002400707505061500731520103001346650001602376650002802392650002602420650001602446650001902462650002002481650004002501650002802541650002602569650001602595650001902611650001702630710003402647773002602681776003602707776003602743776003602779856004602815912001402861912001502875950006102890950006602951978-3-031-29042-8DE-He21320230411100858.0cr nn 008mamaa230411s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312904289978-3-031-29042-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-29042-82doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aEvans, Megan.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aPeer Support Services Reaching People with Schizophreniah[electronic resource] :bConsiderations for Research and Practice /cby Megan Evans.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXV, 161 p. 6 illus., 3 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1.

Summary, implications, and future directions.  aMany mental health providers are seeking guidance in designing and improving peer support programs for people with mental illnesses. However, the evidence base in this area is limited by lack of consensus on the core components of peer support. This research provides a comprehensive, nuanced view of peer support reaching people with schizophrenia. Results of a realist review of 355 sources and interviews with experts in the field are presented. Realist review is an approach to evidence synthesis that asks, ‘What works, for whom, and in what circumstances?’ Results include a typology of key functions of peer support (e.g., being there, linkage to clinical care and community resources, systems advocacy, ongoing support), documented benefits (e.g., decreased acute care utilization, increased recovery), and implementation recommendations (e.g., critical mass of peer workers, supportive infrastructure, an organizational recovery orientation). The book is intended for program planners, managers, and researchers. 0aPsychology. 0aEducational psychology. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aPsychiatry. 0aPublic health. 0aSocial service.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aEducational Psychology.24aCognitive Psychology.24aPsychiatry.24aPublic Health.24aSocial Work.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303129041108iPrinted edition:z978303129043508iPrinted edition:z978303129044240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-29042-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04033nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202072001500225082001400240245011900254250001800373264007500391300006600466336002600532337002600558338003600584347002400620505148100644520078502125650001402910650001702924650002902941650002102970650001302991650004503004650003103049700007703080710003403157773002603191776003603217776003603253776003603289856004603325912001403371912001503385950006103400950006603461978-3-031-24220-5DE-He21320230428133002.0cr nn 008mamaa230417s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312422059978-3-031-24220-57 a10.1007/978-3-031-24220-52doi 4aBF531-593 7aJMQ2bicssc 7aPSY0130002bisacsh 7aJMQ2thema04a152.422314aThe Affective Profiles Modelh[electronic resource] :b20 Years of Research and Beyond /cedited by Danilo Garcia.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXVII, 315 p. 28 illus., 22 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aPart 1: Concepts and Methods -- CHAPTER 1 - The Affective Profiles Model -- CHAPTER 2 – Two Dimensions and Two Measures -- CHAPTER 3 – Regulatory Mode Profiles Vs.

It presents the etiology underpinning the affective system and compares the model with other existing personality models, such as the Big Five Model, and the Cloninger’s Biopsychosocial Model. Most important, it examines the affective profiles model in relation to well-being, which includes life satisfaction, as well as psychological health. As such, it illuminates the problems of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Based on a wealth of longitudinal, cross-cultural and intervention studies, this book offers a critical view of the affective profiles model that will enrich both further research and clinical practice. 0aEmotions. 0aPersonality. 0aDifference (Psychology). 0aEthnopsychology.14aEmotion.24aPersonality and Differential Psychology.24aCross-Cultural Psychology.1 aGarcia, Danilo.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124219908iPrinted edition:z978303124221208iPrinted edition:z978303124222940uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24220-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)02960nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100009200248245017400340250001800514264006900532300004100601336002600642337002600668338003600694347002400730490004500754505015100799520087200950650001601822650001401838650001501852650003201867650001901899650004001918650001301958650001501971650002201986650001902008710003402027773002602061776003602087776003602123830004502159856004602204912001402250912001502264950006102279950006602340978-3-031-27384-1DE-He21320230419085018.0cr nn 008mamaa230419s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312738419978-3-031-27384-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-27384-12doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aHolm-Hadulla, Rainer Matthias.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Creative Transformation of Despair, Hate, and Violenceh[electronic resource] :bWhat we can learn from Madonna, Mick Jagger & Co /cby Rainer Matthias Holm-Hadulla.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aIX, 69 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-83710 a1.

Only with creativity can we overcome despair, hatred and violence, in the world and in ourselves. Using selected examples of exceptionally creative people, Rainer M. Holm-Hadulla encourages us to unleash our own creative and social potential. Readers become acquainted with Madonna and Amy Winehouse, John Lennon, Jim Morrison, and Mick Jagger. Before wandering through their lives and work in the interplay of constructive and destructive forces, they encounter the "Big Five of Creativity": talent, ability, motivation, resilience, favorable environments. The author has theoretically researched their interaction over decades, tested them in practice and drawn the conclusion: The creative transformation of human destructiveness is our chance to lead a fulfilled life in social responsibility. 0aPsychology. 0aEmotions. 0aCognition. 0aArt, Modern—21st century. 0aPopular music.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aEmotion.24aCognition.24aContemporary Art.24aPopular Music.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303127383408iPrinted edition:z9783031273858 0aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-837140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27384-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03092nam a22005295i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243100007700255245011200332250001800444264008500462300004400547336002600591337002600617338003600643347002400679505049700703520075201200650003001952650002901982650002302011650002602034650003002060650002702090650002602117650002302143650002602166710003402192773002602226776003602252776003602288776003602324856004602360912001402406912001502420950006102435950006602496978-3-031-28647-6DE-He21320230626145033.0cr nn 008mamaa230421s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312864769978-3-031-28647-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-28647-62doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a1552231 aHagström, Tom.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Developing Human Mindh[electronic resource] :bA Duality System of Meaning Making /cby Tom Hagström.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXIV, 199 p. 10 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1: Introduction -- Chapter 2: A developing phenomenon in modern societies -- Chapter 3: The generality of stage transformations -- Chapter 4: The evolution towards self-consciousness -- Chapter 5: Basic abstract duality distinctions -- Chapter 6: The transforming duality forms -- Chapter 7: The meta system character -- Chapter 8: The duality system as cognition, socialization, and organization -- Chapter 9: General conclusions, intelligence, and challenges.

These transitions have to be approached, shaped, processed and integrated into our lives in some way. Regardless of the belief in a God, traditional structures always come into view, here especially religiously traditional rites of passage such as baptism and circumcision, communion or bar/bat mitzvah, marriage as well as convalescence, death and funeral rites. What is the psychological function of religiously traditional rites of passage today? This question will be investigated with the help of interactive interviews with functionaries and members of the religious communities of all three monotheistic currents in Northern Europe, flanked by two interviews with atheists. The author Kathrin Rothenberg-Elder, grew up in Niger, Algeria and Germany; studied psychology, practical theology and modern German literature, doctorate on Christian threshold rituals. Professor of psychology at the diploma university (focus on social and environmental psychology), numerous exhibitions as a photographer in Germany and abroad (focus on interreligious dialogue) and publications as an author (focus on specialist literature and poetry). This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation. 0aPsychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978365839950408iPrinted edition:z978365839952840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-39951-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04862nam a22005415i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245011700248250001800365264007500383300006600458336002600524337002600550338003600576347002400612490006800636505104700704520186301751650001603614650002603630650001503656650002303671650004003694650002603734650001503760650002303775700008403798710003403882773002603916776003603942776003603978776003604014830006804050856004604118912001404164912001504178950006104193950006604254978-3-031-26677-5DE-He21320230425082258.0cr nn 008mamaa230425s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312667759978-3-031-26677-57 a10.1007/978-3-031-26677-52doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aRe-Inventing Organic Metaphors for the Social Sciencesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Marc Antoine Campill.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXVII, 263 p. 61 illus., 31 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aTheory and History in the Human and Social Sciences,x2523-86710 a1.

Conclusion: Following innovation into the wasteland: Re-inventing organic metaphors.  aThe “Re-Inventing Organic Metaphors for the Social Sciences” is a volume with the specific goal: to challenge psychological understandings by connecting psychological approaches with multidimensional perspectives of various other scientific streams, meanwhile imbedding the generated knowledge in metaphors that allows researchers to follow phenomena into a deeper and more (w)holistic understanding of its appearance. This is particularly important when the humankind faces challenges due to systemic biological changes, as the phenomenological dynamics bonded to those challenges can be conserved in appropriated context. For this purpose, the organic metaphors are introduced. A tool that has central advantage over mechanical metaphors as it can capture the complex and open-systemic nature of biological, psychological, and social phenomena. For example—the widely used notion “mind as a computer” may be more productively replaced by “mind as a membrane”—with implications (e.g. focus on borders in-between, or in systems in themselves- exosystemic realities in our world). There are many other fertile opportunities not yet explored in the realms of psychology and other sciences. Furthermore, the contributors operated also as cross-reviewers for each other’s. In this occasion a new dimension, in chapter construction, will be introduced. Beside the traditional reviewing of another paper the reviewer has been asked to add a small list of extending questions toward the reviewed paper. These added questions have been introduced as potential questions that the authors were demanded to add into a final sub-chapter of their contribution. The subchapter has been titled as “Dialogue” (the author was free to select between the questions and ideas on those they believe could inhabit an especially worth for the future readers). 0aPsychology. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aCognition. 0aSocial psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCognitive Psychology.24aCognition.24aSocial Psychology.1 aCampill, Marc Antoine.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303126676808iPrinted edition:z978303126678208iPrinted edition:z9783031266799 0aTheory and History in the Human and Social Sciences,x2523-867140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-26677-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06939nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001900172072001600191072002300207072001500230082001500245245018300260250001800443264007500461300006500536336002600601337002600627338003600653347002400689505298800713520182903701650002505530650001905555650002505574650001605599650002505615650001905640650001905659650001605678700009005694700007905784700007705863700007505940710003406015773002606049776003606075776003606111776003606147856004606183912001406229912001506243950006106258950006606319978-3-031-27003-1DE-He21320230425194910.0cr nn 008mamaa230425s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312700319978-3-031-27003-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-27003-12doi 4aRC466.8-467.97 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922310aPsychological Interventions for Psychosish[electronic resource] :bTowards a Paradigm Shift /cedited by Juan Antonio Díaz-Garrido, Raquel Zúñiga, Horus Laffite, Eric Morris.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXVI, 811 p. 54 illus., 37 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1 - Toward a change of paradigm in psychosis: A contextual phenomenological approach -- Chapter 2 - Eppur si mouve -- Chapter 3 - Rethinking Antipsychotics: Evidence-Based Medicine Calls for A Dramatic Change in Their Use -- Chapter 4 - Psychosis pills do much more harm than good and should not be used -- Chapter 5 - Advocating for integrated therapy in the social environment to treat schizophrenia problems -- Chapter 6 - Contextualizing ‘psychosis’ behaviors and what to do about them -- Chapter 7 - Culturally adapted CBT for psychosis  -- Chapter 8 - The Power Threat Meaning Framework & ‘psychosis’ -- Chapter 9 - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Psychosis -- Chapter 10 - Person-Based Cognitive Therapy for Psychosis -- Chapter 11 - The phenomenological perspective and metacognitive psychotherapy in addressing psychosis -- Chapter 12 - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): Contextual therapy in the approach to psychosis -- Chapter 13 - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Recovery from Psychosis -- Chapter 14 - Acceptance & Commitment Therapy for psychosis in an inpatient context -- Chapter 15 - Using acceptance and commitment therapy within a functional analysis informed therapy for hearing voices -- Chapter 16 - The use of Therapist Self-Disclosure in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Psychosis -- Chapter 17 - Acceptance and Recovery Therapy by levels for Psychosis (ART).

It brings together both theoretical chapters that contribute to the reconceptualization of psychosis and clinical cases illustrating how contemporary psychotherapeutic intervention models can be applied in the treatment of this mental health condition, with reflections, strategies and practical guidelines demonstrating how these models can inform professional practice in mental healthcare. Chapters brought together in this volume aim to reflect a paradigm shift in psychosis care. They present person-centered models that lead to a way of seeing, understanding and treating psychosis that is very different from the traditional biomedical model. Current authors and approaches are revolutionizing an outdated model trapped in purely pharmacological actions and tautological explanations of a biological nature, where symptom control is the basic and fundamental form of approach, and in which psychotherapeutic actions take second place as subsidiary to the former. Approaches such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Acceptance and Recovery Therapy by Levels, Open Dialogue, Compassion-Centered Therapy or the Hearing Voices movement, to name but a few of those presented in this book, represent a journey of self-knowledge and learning for those recovering from psychosis, and have an intense transformative potential for the therapeutic team. The fundamental principle that guides this book is to share models belonging to psychology that aim at personal development while respecting the needs, values and goals of each person, and that can be adopted by any professional or student of clinical psychology, psychiatry, nursing, social work or any other discipline searching for more humanistic approaches to treat psychosis. 0aClinical psychology. 0aMental health. 0aPsychotherapy   . 0aPsychiatry.14aClinical Psychology.24aMental Health.24aPsychotherapy.24aPsychiatry.1 aDíaz-Garrido, Juan Antonio.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aZúñiga, Raquel.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aLaffite, Horus.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aMorris, Eric.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303127002408iPrinted edition:z978303127004808iPrinted edition:z978303127005540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27003-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)07279nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202072001500225082001500240245013500255250001800390264007500408300003400483336002600517337002600543338003600569347002400605490005600629505279600685520248103481650002305962650001605985650002306001650002306024650003006047650002306077650001606100650002606116650003406142650003206176700007906208710003406287773002606321776003606347776003606383776003606419830005606455856004606511912001406557912001506571950006106586950006606647978-3-031-19964-6DE-He21320230429214806.0cr nn 008mamaa230429s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311996469978-3-031-19964-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-19964-62doi 4aLB1027.55 7aJNC2bicssc 7aPSY0040002bisacsh 7aJNC2thema04a370.1522310aHandbook of Applied Behavior Analysish[electronic resource] :bIntegrating Research into Practice  /cedited by Johnny L.

It makes an important - and original - contribution to the scholarship on African and decolonial feminism.” —Derek Hook, Associate Professor in Psychology at Duquesne University, USA, and Extraordinary Professor in Psychology at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. This book draws on a unique theoretical framework informed by clinical case studies, Fanonian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, and decolonial feminism, to examine the concept of adornment in African cultures. The book discusses the construction of aesthetic feminine ideals and the evolution of such ideals within the history of colonization, decolonization and globalization. Through the analysis of adornments including accessories, hairstyle, clothes and fabric, the author demonstrates how they can reflect social status, and also addresses its symbolic function in rituals. At the level of the individual, it draws on clinical case studies to examine the Lacanian theory of adornment and masquerade of femininity, and the extent to which this echoes ambivalent attitudes towards women in society at large. In doing so it provides a nuanced analysis which reveals how body adornment can be a paradoxical demonstration of both strength and weakness. Building on the author’s previous work in this area, this book offers an important contribution to current debates in psychoanalysis, cultural studies, critical race theory and decolonial feminism.

In each of the five essays included in this book, the author establishes a dialogue with key thinkers and intellectual traditions of dialogical approaches arriving at core points of I-other relationships according to the perspective of semiotic-cultural constructivism in psychology. The first essay establishes a dialogue with Greek philosophers such as Parmenides and Aristotle. In the second essay this dialogue is established with semiotic-constructivist psychologists such as Jaan Valsiner, Ragnar Rommetveit and Ivana Marková. The third essay is a dialogue with the contributions of Ernst Boesch’s symbolic action theory. The fourth essay proposes a dialogue between semiotic-cultural constructivists and Hans-Georg Gadamer’s hermeneutics. Finally, the fifth essay proposes how the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas contributes to dialogical studies of I-other in the context of semiotic-cultural constructivism. Originally published in Portuguese for the Brazilian market, Dialogical Essays: From Difference to Sharing in I-Other Relationships is now published in English in an international edition that will be of interest to psychologists, philosophers, historians and other human and social scientists interested in epistemological, ontological and ethical aspects of I-other relationships from the perspective of semiotic-cultural constructivism and cultural psychology. . 0aPsychology. 0aSocial psychology. 0aKnowledge, Theory of. 0aHermeneutics. 0aLanguage and languages—Philosophy.14aTheoretical Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.24aEpistemology.24aHermeneutics.24aPhilosophy of Language.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303130999108iPrinted edition:z978303131001008iPrinted edition:z9783031310027 0aLatin American Voices,  Integrative Psychology and Humanities,x2524-581340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31000-3  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03936nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245009600248250001800344264007500362300004100437336002600478337002600504338003600530347002400566490005500590505049500645520145301140650001602593650002602609650002902635650003302664650002302697650004002720650002202760650003002782650003002812650002202842700008102864710003402945773002602979776003603005776003603041776003603077830005503113856004603168912001403214912001503228950006103243950006603304978-3-031-29789-2DE-He21320230825084905.0cr nn 008mamaa230512s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312978929978-3-031-29789-27 a10.1007/978-3-031-29789-22doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aCanine Cognition and the Human Bondh[electronic resource] /cedited by Jeffrey R.

Program and Future Research Directions -- .  aDogs are a valued part of millions of households worldwide. They also serve many functions in human societies from herding livestock to detecting drugs, explosives, or illegal wildlife to providing physical assistance or emotional support to those in need. Yet, in terms of behavior and cognition, dogs have only become a serious subject of scientific study in the last 20 years. Similarly, we have recently witnessed a sharp increase in studies of canine-human interaction, exploring the motivational, emotional, cognitive, physiological, and neural mechanisms of dogs on human psychology and well-being. This book is a collection of chapters stemming from the Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, which focused on Canine Cognition and the Human Bond. The primary goal of this symposium was to bring together researchers from psychology, biology, neuroscience, and anthropology to delve deeper into the canine-human bond. These chapters describe the current state of knowledge from international experts in the fields of canine cognition and canine-human interaction. Bridging these two areas can help us better understand the canine-human bond, potentially improving the lives of both dogs and people.

The chapters brought together in this contributed volume consider native languages all kinds of languages used in the region, including sign languages, indigenous languages and the romance languages (Portuguese and Spanish) originally introduced by European colonizers which underwent processes of transformation giving rise to new, local grammars. One fourth of the language families of the world are located in South America, but the majority of languages in the region are still understudied and out of the radar of theoretical linguistics mostly because their grammars are not well-known by international researchers. This book aims to fill this gap by bringing together studies rooted in the formal grammar approach first developed by Noam Chomsky, which sees language not only as mere corpora attested in oral and written production, but also as expressions of systems of thought and language production which are essential parts of human cognition. The book is divided in three parts – sign languages, romance languages and indigenous languages –, and brings together studies of the following South American languages: Brazilian Sign Language (Libras - Língua Brasileira de Sinais) Argentinian Sign Language (LSA - Lengua de Señas Argentina) Peruvian Sign Language (LSP- Lengua de Señas Peruana) Brazilian Portuguese Chilean and Argentinian Spanish Quechua Paraguayan Guarani A’ingae Macro-Jê languages Formal Approaches to the Languages of South America will be an invaluable resource both for theoretical linguists and cognitive scientists by providing access to top quality research on understudied languages and enabling these languages to be incorporated into comparative studies that can contribute to advance the knowledge of general principles governing all human languages. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aLinguistics. 0aGrammar, Comparative and general—Syntax. 0aGrammar, Comparative and general—Morphology. 0aIndians—Languages. 0aRomance languages.14aCognitive Psychology.24aTheoretical Linguistics / Grammar.24aSyntax.24aMorphology.24aAmeri-Indian Languages.24aRomance Languages.1 aRodrigues, Cilene.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aSaab, Andrés.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303122343308iPrinted edition:z978303122345708iPrinted edition:z978303122346440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-22344-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04036nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001600190072002300206072001500229082001200244100007900256245019800335250001800533264007500551300004100626336002600667337002600693338003600719347002400755490005700779505032900836520146101165650001702626650001602643650003402659650001702693650001602710650001702726650004002743650002302783650002702806700007802833700007802911700007802989710003403067773002603101776003603127776003603163830005703199856004603256912001403302912001503316950006103331950006603392978-3-031-28100-6DE-He21320230515085002.0cr nn 008mamaa230515s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312810069978-3-031-28100-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-28100-62doi 4aHV6001-7220.5 7aJKV2bicssc 7aSOC0040002bisacsh 7aJKV2thema04a3642231 aFeldman, David M.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aIntersections of the Legal System and the Deaf Communityh[electronic resource] :bFrom Law Enforcement to Incarceration /cby David M.

The Deaf Inmate and the Incarceration.  aThis book examines how those with disabilities, and in particular, the Deaf and hard-of-hearing, are impacted by the influence language and culture in policing, criminal law, and corrections. Frequently left out of policy making and research, almost no resources exist that can inform and aid law enforcement, legal, and correctional officials on culturally competent interactions with the Deaf and hard-of-hearing. As a result, this group is at a distinct disadvantage when dealing with law enforcement or the courts as well as being vastly underserved, which often lead to negative outcomes for the Deaf suspect/defendant/inmate as they attempt to interact with law enforcement and navigate the legal system. In a step-by-step presentation from arrest to incarceration each chapter will discuss a specific part of the legal system. As well as providing information on the topic, this book can serve as an important resource to the myriad of issues and difficulties that may be experiences by the Deaf suspect, defendant, or inmate, as well as by law enforcement officers, attorneys, and correctional officers. To illustrate these issues, previous cases of Deaf suspects, defendants, and inmates will be presented and discussed to clarify key issues and to provide a perspective of the problem. Each chapter dealing with these issues will also provide suggestions for more culturally competent interactions between the Deaf community and the legal system. 0aCriminology. 0aPsychology. 0aCrime—Sociological aspects. 0aCorrections. 0aPunishment.14aCriminology.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCrime and Society.24aPrison and Punishment.1 aSilvasi, Paul M.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aRotshtyn, Dayna.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aCovell, Caleigh.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303128099308iPrinted edition:z9783031281013 0aSpringerBriefs in Behavioral Criminology,x2194-187440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-28100-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04969nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100008400248245027700332250001800609264007500627300006600702336002600768337002600794338003600820347002400856505039900880520206301279650001603342650002603358650002303384650002203407650002903429650004003458650002603498650002303524650002203547650002903569700008203598700008103680700007603761700008203837700007803919710003403997773002604031776003604057776003604093776003604129856004604165912001404211912001504225950006104240950006604301978-3-031-31172-7DE-He21320230518131959.0cr nn 008mamaa230518s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313117279978-3-031-31172-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-31172-72doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aFarahani, Hojjatollah.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut13aAn Introduction to Artificial Psychologyh[electronic resource] :bApplication Fuzzy Set Theory and Deep Machine Learning in Psychological Research using R /cby Hojjatollah Farahani, Marija Blagojević, Parviz Azadfallah, Peter Watson, Forough Esrafilian, Sara Saljoughi.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXX, 252 p. 158 illus., 150 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aIntroduction Chapter 1: After Method -- Chapter 2: Overview on Mathematical Basis of Fuzzy Set Theory. - Chapter 3: Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS)  -- Chapter 4: Fuzzy Cognitive Maps(FCM) -- Chapter 5: Network analysis  -- Chapter 6: Association Rules Mining and Associative Classification  -- Chapter 7: Artificial Neural Network  -- Chapter 8: Feature Selection -- Chapter 9: Cluster analysis.  aArtificial Psychology (AP) is a highly multidisciplinary field of study in psychology. AP tries to solve problems which occur when psychologists do research and need a robust analysis method. Conventional statistical approaches have deep rooted limitations. These approaches are excellent on paper but often fail to model the real world. Mind researchers have been trying to overcome this by simplifying the models being studied. This stance has not received much practical attention recently. Promoting and improving artificial intelligence helps mind researchers to find a holistic model of mental models. This development achieves this goal by using multiple perspectives and multiple data sets together with interactive, and realistic models. In this book, the methodology of approximate inference in psychological research from a theoretical and practical perspective has been considered. Quantitative variable-oriented methodology and qualitative case-oriented methods are both used to explain the set-oriented methodology and this book combines the precision of quantitative methods with information from qualitative methods. This is a book that many researchers can use to expand and deepen their psychological research and is a book which can be useful to postgraduate students. The reader does not need an in-depth knowledge of mathematics or statistics because statistical and mathematical intuitions are key here and they will be learned through practice. What is important is to understand and use the new application of the methods for finding new, dynamic and realistic interpretations. This book incorporates theoretical fuzzy inference and deep machine learning algorithms in practice. This is the kind of book that we wished we had had when we were students. This book covers at least some of the most important issues in mind research including uncertainty, fuzziness, continuity, complexity and high dimensionality which are inherent to mind data. These are elements of artificial psychology. This book implements models using R software. 0aPsychology. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aCognitive science. 0aMachine learning. 0aArtificial intelligence.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCognitive Psychology.24aCognitive Science.24aMachine Learning.24aArtificial Intelligence.1 aBlagojević, Marija.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aAzadfallah, Parviz.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aWatson, Peter.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aEsrafilian, Forough.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aSaljoughi, Sara.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131171008iPrinted edition:z978303131173408iPrinted edition:z978303131174140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31172-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03232nam a22006255i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001500188072001500203072002300218072001400241072001400255082001400269245016700283250001800450264008500468300003400553336002600587337002600613338003600639347002400675520094300699650001601642650003001658650002201688650002801710650001901738650001301757650003001770650001301800650002701813650002401840650002801864650001901892650001301911650002801924700008601952700008002038700007702118710003402195773003102229776003602260856004602296912001402342912001502356912001502371950006102386950007502447950008402522978-3-030-56781-1DE-He21320230822192549.0cr nn 008mamaa230519s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830305678119978-3-030-56781-17 a10.1007/978-3-030-56781-12doi 4aBF81-107.L4 7aJM2bicssc 7aHB2bicssc 7aPSY0150002bisacsh 7aJM2thema 7aNH2thema04a150.922314aThe Palgrave Biographical Encyclopedia of Psychology in Latin Americah[electronic resource] /cedited by Ana Maria Jacó-Vilela, Hugo Klappenbach, Rubén Ardila.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aeReference.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  aThis biographical encyclopedia will provide the first comprehensive reference work on leading scholars and professionals who have contributed to the development and institutionalization of psychology in Latin America.

It will offer an invaluable reference point, in particular for scholars of the history of psychology, Latin American studies, the history of science, and global psychology; as well as for historians, psychologists and social scientists seeking international perspectives on the development of the discipline. 0aPsychology. 0aSocial sciencesxHistory. 0aSciencexHistory. 0aLatin AmericaxHistory. 0aBiotechnology. 0aHistory. 0aEthnologyxLatin America. 0aCulture.14aHistory of Psychology.24aHistory of Science.24aLatin American History.24aBiotechnology.24aHistory.24aLatin American Culture.1 aJacó-Vilela, Ana Maria.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aKlappenbach, Hugo.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aArdila, Rubén.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eReference08iPrinted edition:z978303056780440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56781-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXRH  aZDB-2-SXBE  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aReference Module Humanities and Social Sciences (SpringerNature-43749)  aReference Module Business, Economics and Social Sciences (SpringerNature-85196)05515nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001000172072001600182072002300198072001500221082001500236082001400251100008300265245017200348250001800520264007500538300003500613336002600648337002600674338003600700347002400736490005400760505095900814520238701773650002304160650003904183650002304222650001904245650003004264650003304294650002604327650003104353650002304384650001904407650003804426650002504464710003404489773002604523776003604549776003604585776003604621830005404657856004604711912001404757912001504771950006104786950006604847978-3-031-28823-4DE-He21320230519133320.0cr nn 008mamaa230519s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312882349978-3-031-28823-47 a10.1007/978-3-031-28823-42doi 4aRC455 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922304a362.22231 aMorgan-Mullane, Anna.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut13aAn Integrative Approach to Clinical Social Work Practice with Children of Incarcerated Parentsh[electronic resource] :bA Clinician's Guide /cby Anna Morgan-Mullane.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXII, 139 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aEssential Clinical Social Work Series,x2520-16110 aPart I: Intersectionality of Social Work Practice and Mass Incarceration,- Why Criminal Justice Is Relevant to All Clinical Practitioners -- Impact of Secondary Incarceration: Collateral Consequences for Children and Families -- Psychosocial Stressors for Children of Incarcerated Parents: Conspiracy of Silence and Ambiguous Loss -- Part II: Clinical Applications Grounded in Cultural Responsiveness -- Narrative Therapy -- Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy -- Prolonged Exposure Therapy for PTSD -- Attachment Theory and Relational Therapy -- Mitigation and Advocacy -- Part III: Enhancing Practice Through Supervision and Training -- Supervision and the Therapeutic Alliance: Critical Consciousness and Anti-racist Clinical Training and Undoing -- Clinical Partnership: Application of Dismantling Anti-Blackness Through Anti-oppressive Practice and Critical Consciousness -- An Integrative Model to Transform Clinical Practice -- Conclusion.  aThis book is an essential clinician's guide to understanding, unpacking, treating, and healing individual, familial, and communal wounds associated with parental incarceration. Readers gain familiarity with integrative micro and macro healing techniques and modalities that are currently being utilized as anti-racist, anti-oppressive, and innovative practices. They also develop an understanding of and deeper unpacking of their own biases within the therapeutic relationship. The book offers an extensive overview of clinical practice models such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, narrative therapy, and relational and attachment-based therapy for treating trauma symptoms associated with children of incarcerated parents, their families, and their surrounding communities. The author provides guidance on healing complex trauma through phase-oriented, multimodal, and skill-focused treatment approaches, with emphasis on strengthening one's own narrative of power and pain while building community in supportive spaces. Among the topics covered: Why Criminal Justice Is Relevant to All Clinical Practitioners Impact of Secondary Incarceration: Collateral Consequences for Children and Families Psychosocial Stressors for Children of Incarcerated Parents: Conspiracy of Silence and Ambiguous Loss Supervision and the Therapeutic Alliance: Critical Consciousness and Anti-racist Clinical Training and Undoing Clinical Partnership: Application of Dismantling Anti-Blackness Through Anti-oppressive Practice and Critical Consciousness An Integrative Approach to Clinical Social Work Practice with Children of Incarcerated Parents enhances therapeutic relationships for social workers, teaches innovative clinical practices most effective for this population, and offers a comprehensive discussion and understanding of the complex traumas faced both historically and presently by children and families impacted by the criminal justice system. Although designed to inspire and train social workers, the guide has significantly wide-ranging application for mental health and medical providers and other clinicians interested in enhancing their work with children and families impacted by the criminal justice system in diverse clinical practice settings. Lay practitioners and policymakers within government and not-for-profit settings also will find the book of interest. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aSystemic therapy (Family therapy). 0aSchool Psychology. 0aSocial policy. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aLaw and the social sciences.14aClinical Social Work.24aSystems or Family Therapy.24aSchool Psychology.24aSocial Policy.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.24aSocio-Legal Studies.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303128822708iPrinted edition:z978303128824108iPrinted edition:z9783031288258 0aEssential Clinical Social Work Series,x2520-161140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-28823-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03529nam a22004695i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202072001500225082001500240245015600255250001800411264007600429300006200505336002600567337002600593338003600619347002400655505021500679520156900894650002302463650002802486650002302514650002802537700008002565700008002645710003402725773002602759776003602785776003602821856004602857912001402903912001502917950006102932950006602993978-3-658-40709-4DE-He21320230522140934.0cr nn 008mamaa230522s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836584070949978-3-658-40709-47 a10.1007/978-3-658-40709-42doi 4aLB1027.55 7aJNC2bicssc 7aPSY0040002bisacsh 7aJNC2thema04a370.1522310aRacism in Schoolsh[electronic resource] :bHistory, Explanations, Impact, and Intervention Approaches /cedited by Matthias Böhmer, Georges Steffgen.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aWiesbaden :bSpringer Fachmedien Wiesbaden :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aX, 198 p. 12 illus., 3 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aHow to explain racist behaviors -- Effects of racist discrimination -- Recognizing, preventing, intervening: (self-)reflexive prevention and intervention approaches for a practice critical of racism in schools.  aRacism, i.e. discrimination against people on the basis of their perceived ethnic origin, is pervasive in schools. Apart from students, pre-service teachers and teachers, all actors in the school context are affected by this topic. Why is this so? How can racist discrimination be explained? What effects does this behavior have on those affected? And how can schools counteract it? These are all questions that arise and which this book aims to answer with the intention of enabling all those acting in the school context to critically examine their own knowledge bases relevant to racism. This book contributes to the development of school as a racism-sensitive space in which all actors behave in a racism-sensitive manner. Therefore, in addition to an overview of the history of racism, approaches to explaining racist behaviors and effects of racial discrimination, prevention and intervention approaches for a practice critical of racism in schools are presented. The editors Dr. Matthias Böhmer, graduate psychologist, is a psychological psychotherapist. He is an academic at several universities (since 2008 at the University of Luxembourg) and conducts research in the field of empirical educational research and on REBT. Dr. Georges Steffgen, graduate psychologist, is Professor of Social and Work Psychology at the University of Luxembourg and conducts research on aggression, emotion regulation and health promotion.

It incorporates state-of-the-art theories of hope from psychology, philosophy and theology and presents a novel approach to the study of hope in different life situations. The volume analyses empirical data from the Hope Barometer international research network, collected from more than 40,000 participants between 2017 and 2021. The authors use this broad database to investigate the nature and value of hope for well-being and flourishing at individual and societal levels, in various regions, and different cultural, religious and social backgrounds. The chapters study the cultural characteristics of different facets and elements of hope and furthermore explore its common qualities to elucidate the universal nature of hope across cultures. Comprehensive, transdisciplinary and cross-cultural in scope, this volume is of interest to a global readership across the social and behavioural sciences. . 0aPositive psychology. 0aQuality of life. 0aEthnopsychology. 0aWell-being.14aPositive Psychology.24aQuality of Life Research.24aCross-Cultural Psychology.24aWell-Being.1 aKrafft, Andreas M.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aGuse, Tharina.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aSlezackova, Alena.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124411708iPrinted edition:z978303124413108iPrinted edition:z9783031244148 0aCross-Cultural Advancements in Positive Psychology,x2210-5425 ;v1440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24412-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aZDB-2-SOB  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06590nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001600184072002300200072001600223082001700239245021400256250001800470264007500488300004200563336002600605337002600631338003600657347002400693505206500717520205002782650002504832650002104857650002004878650002604898650002504924650003204949650001704981650002804998650003105026700015205057700014805209700014705357700015005504710003405654773002605688776003605714776003605750776003605786856004605822912001405868912001505882950006105897950006605958978-3-031-28827-2DE-He21320230527150113.0cr nn 008mamaa230527s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312882729978-3-031-28827-27 a10.1007/978-3-031-28827-22doi 4aBF204.6 7aJMA2bicssc 7aPSY0450002bisacsh 7aJMAP2thema04a150.198822310aBeyond WEIRD: Psychobiography in Times of Transcultural and Transdisciplinary Perspectivesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Claude-Hélène Mayer, Roelf van Niekerk, Paul J.P.

It creates a platform for researchers, scholars and scientists from diverse backgrounds to put forth new theoretical and methodological stances in psychobiography, thereby making the field more inclusive, diverse and equitable. The chapters in this volume investigate the role of context across the life course of non-WEIRD psychological subjects, as well as the interplay between them and their environments across the life span. They further elucidate cognitive, affective and behavioural aspects of individuals with non-WEIRD backgrounds. The volume provides a broad and at the same time in-depth perspective into psychobiography beyond the usual contexts and therefore has new and original learnings to offer across disciplines and cultures. It is a breakthrough in terms of its transcultural and transdisciplinary insights into lives lived in different contexts in the world. "Every person is in certain respects (a) like all other persons, (b) like some other persons, (c) like no other persons. This book is a challenging and fascinating exploration of extending psychobiography beyond its origins in Europe and America to women and men of different races and social and economic classes from Africa, Asia, and around the world. At its best, psychobiography can increase people's awareness of their own subjective experience and that of others, contributing to movements for social, cultural and political change."

University faculty teaching diversity and social justice have traditionally encountered various forms of student resistance. Recent cultural trends of political opposition to teaching critical race theory and other forms of increased polarization and scapegoating with decreased levels of social tolerance have exacerbated challenges in promoting student engagement in diversity and social justice education in universities and colleges. In contrast to traditional models that tend to be confrontational in addressing student biases, the new Moving Towards Social Justice (MTSJ), Relational Partnership Development Model (RPDM) and process theoretical models seek to build on appropriate pre-existing strengths, interests, values, and the developmental readiness of students who might otherwise oppose learning about the contexts, lives, and predicaments of marginalized persons living in various intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity and ability/disability status. Emphasis is placed on the development of professional and life skills, such as wisdom and intercultural competence, which provide incentives and remove barriers to learning about social justice and diversity. Project-based learning approaches grounded in a developmental framework to foster the thriving and well-being of diverse students, collaborative partners in the community, and diverse persons served by the community partners are emphasized. The role of empirical assessment, feedback, and program refinement over time is also delineated within the models. Subverting Resistance to Social Justice and Diversity Education: Constructive Approaches with Undergraduate Students is an indispensable and timely resource for university and college instructors who teach courses or have significant portions of a class that involve education around social justice, diversity, and intersectionality issues, such as cross-cultural psychology, multicultural psychology, social work, sociology, intercultural communication, and counseling or clinical practice with individuals or families from diverse social locations. University officers of diversity, faculty development providers, and other administrators interested in empowering university faculty to increase student engagement in social justice and diversity education also would find the book a useful reference. 0aSocial justice. 0aSocial work education. 0aEthnopsychology. 0aSociology. 0aCounseling. 0aIntercultural communication.14aSocial Justice.24aSocial Work Education.24aCross-Cultural Psychology.24aSociology.24aCounseling.24aIntercultural Communication.1 aJohnson, Andy J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aVinding, April.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131712508iPrinted edition:z9783031317149 0aSpringerBriefs in Social Work,x2195-311240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31713-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03438nam a22005295i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007900248245012400327250001800451264007200469300006300541336002600604337002600630338003600656347002400692490006500716505014000781520141200921650001602333650002202349650001902371650002002390650004002410650002102450650001902471650001902490710003402509773002602543776003602569776003602605830006502641856004602706912001402752912001502766950006102781950006602842978-981-99-2359-5DE-He21320230529102806.0cr nn 008mamaa230529s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898199235959978-981-99-2359-57 a10.1007/978-981-99-2359-52doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aBennett, Gabriel.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aAutistic People in Dental and Medical Clinicsh[electronic resource] :bChallenges and Solutions /cby Gabriel Bennett.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aSingapore :bSpringer Nature Singapore :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXI, 153 p. 3 illus., 2 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aNew Perspectives in Behavioral & Health Sciences,x2731-930X0 aChapter1. Introduction -- Chapter2. Autistics in medical settings -- Chapter3. Autistics in dental clinics -- Chapter5. Final comments.  aWith 1 in 44 people now being diagnosed as autistic, there is a view that clinical environments should be “autistic friendly”. However, despite this expectation, medical and dental students are rarely taught how they can make their future clinical workplaces comfortable for autistic patients. Similarly, allied health professional, such as occupational therapists and psychologists, are also not taught this information. Due to this lack of knowledge, each day countless autistics and their families are exposed to potentially stressful clinical situations that can jeopardise the delivery of effective treatment. To help mitigate this situation, this book will give university students as well as established healthcare professionals an understanding of how they can assist autistic patients in clinical settings. This book is more than just providing strategies that aspiring and established healthcare professionals can use to make their clinical workplaces more accommodating for autistics and their families. It will also present a synopsis of the literature about the challenges and experiences that autistic patients have had in dental and medical settings. Such information can provide the reader with a greater understanding about what it is like to be autistic and receive medical and/or dental treatment. This synopsis will also illustrate the current gaps in our knowledge about this topic. 0aPsychology. 0aMedical sciences. 0aPublic health. 0aMedical policy.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aHealth Sciences.24aPublic Health.24aHealth Policy.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981992358808iPrinted edition:z9789819923601 0aNew Perspectives in Behavioral & Health Sciences,x2731-930X40uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-2359-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)02700nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172072001800183072002300201072001700224082001600241245017400257250001800431264007200449300006500521336002600586337002600612338003600638347002400674520064100698650003201339650002301371650002801394650001601422650001701438650001501455650002301470650002301493650004001516650001601556650002301572650001501595700007801610700007601688710003401764773002601798776003601824776003601860776003601896856004601932912001401978912001501992950006102007950006602068978-981-99-2613-8DE-He21320230529033416.0cr nn 008mamaa230529s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898199261389978-981-99-2613-87 a10.1007/978-981-99-2613-82doi 4aR726.7 7aMBNH92bicssc 7aPSY0030002bisacsh 7aMBNH92thema04a613.01922310aApplied Psychology Readingsh[electronic resource] :bSelected Papers from the Singapore Conference on Applied Psychology 2022 /cedited by Peter Macaulay, Lee-Ming Tan.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aSingapore :bSpringer Nature Singapore :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIII, 143 p. 10 illus., 4 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  aThis book is a compilation of the best papers presented at the 2022 edition of the Singapore Conference of Applied Psychology (SCAP), led by East Asia Research in Singapore in collaboration with the University of Derby in the UK and the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

Given the expectation that other flu pandemics will occur, it stresses the importance of examining how the public response is shaped in the face of global health emergencies. It considers questions such as how can pandemic language both limit and expand our understanding of disease as biomedical, social, and experiential? In what ways can health communication be improved through the study and application of rhetoric and the health humanities? COVID Communication fills a gap in the pandemic literature by promoting interdisciplinary analysis of communication methods, realized through a health humanities approach.

It addresses the issues of power and justice that they face in family therapy training programs, including their teaching experiences with students, interactions with faculty, and challenges within academic institutions. It describes how family therapy programs attempt to incorporate cultural awareness with mixed results (e.g., focusing only on how to work with diverse clients or not supporting faculty from across social locations). The book explores the ways in which family therapy educators with intersecting marginalized identities continue to be oppressed across different areas of academia. The book addresses issues of power that systemic family therapy educators face within the academia itself at three different levels: Personal interactions with students that create more complete understanding of issues of power. Professional interactions with colleagues that provide support and accountability. Political interventions aimed at changing the larger academic institution. Chapters focus on countering unjust practices in academic settings. Authors reflect on personal experiences across these three levels and, then, offer concrete suggestions for intervention. These include teaching experiences or meaningful interactions with students that support empowerment or increased awareness; relationships with colleagues that promote accountability and growth; and needed changes or challenges to the larger structure of academia. Social Justice and Systemic Family Therapy Training is an essential resource for clinicians, therapists, and practitioners as well as researchers, professors, and graduate students in family studies, clinical psychology, and public health as well as all interrelated disciplines. 0aPsychotherapy   . 0aSystemic therapy (Family therapy). 0aTeaching. 0aClinical psychology. 0aPublic health. 0aSocial psychiatry.14aPsychotherapy.24aSystems or Family Therapy.24aPedagogy.24aClinical Psychology.24aPublic Health.24aClinical Social Work.1 aNice, Lindsey A.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aEppler, Christie.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0001-6445-26531https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6445-26534edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303129929208iPrinted edition:z9783031299315 0aAFTA SpringerBriefs in Family Therapy,x2196-553640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-29930-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03936nam a22006495i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201072001500224082001500239245031500254250001800569264007200587300006600659336002600725337002600751338003600777347002400813490004800837505023800885520094501123650002802068650002302096650002102119650004102140650002202181650001702203650004702220650002302267650002202290650002202312650004102334650002502375700007402400700007602474700007502550700007502625700008002700700008802780710003402868773002602902776003602928776003602964776003603000830004803036856004603084912001403130912001503144950006103159950006603220978-981-19-8159-3DE-He21320230531123351.0cr nn 008mamaa230531s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898119815939978-981-19-8159-37 a10.1007/978-981-19-8159-32doi 4aR856-857 7aMQW2bicssc 7aTEC0590002bisacsh 7aMQW2thema04a610.2822310aAdvancing Sports and Exercise via Innovationh[electronic resource] :bProceedings of the 9th Asian South Pacific Association of Sport Psychology International Congress (ASPASP) 2022, Kuching, Malaysia /cedited by Garry Kuan, Yu-Kai Chang, Tony Morris, Teo Eng Wah, Rabiu Muazu Musa, Anwar P.

The study uses a qualitative research design within the hermeneutical interpretative research paradigm, aiming to understand the interlinkages of TRLR, SOC, and ID. Based on purposive and snowball sampling techniques, the study includes 22 participants (12 female and 10 male) between 23 and 68 years of age, from 14 different (self-defined) cultural backgrounds. At the time of the interview, participants had been in TRLRs for at least 6 months to a maximum of 26 years. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed through content analysis. Qualitative quality criteria and ethical considerations were applied. The findings show that TRLRs are firmly based on relationship qualities, strong feelings, common actions, spirituality, and future orientation. Further, the findings present clear interlinkages between TRLR and SOC, contributing positively to meaningfulness, manageability, and comprehensibility. Finally, TRLRs support SOC on intrapersonal, cultural, and interpersonal levels. In addition, they influence the development of identity awareness, actions, feelings, and sexual SOC. Conclusions, limitations, and recommendations for theory and practice are provided. 0aPositive psychology. 0aWell-being. 0aCulture—Study and teaching. 0aReligion and culture.14aPositive Psychology.24aWell-Being.24aCultural Studies.24aCross-cultural Studies.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303129532408iPrinted edition:z9783031295348 0aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-837140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-29533-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03405nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001500186072002300201072001400224082001400238100007600252245012500328250001800453264007600471300004300547336002600590337002600616338003600642347002400678490003600702505021300738520142500951650003202376650002802408650002302436650001602459650004002475650001402515710003402529773002602563776003602589776003602625830003602661856004602697912001402743912001502757950006102772950006602833978-3-658-39782-1DE-He21320230601202419.0cr nn 008mamaa230601s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836583978219978-3-658-39782-17 a10.1007/978-3-658-39782-12doi 4aBF637.C56 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0100002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a158.32231 aHuber, Monika.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aResilience In The Teamh[electronic resource] :bIdeas And Application Concepts For Team Development /cby Monika Huber.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aWiesbaden :bSpringer Fachmedien Wiesbaden :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXII, 56 p. 19 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringer essentials,x2731-31150 aResilience research and selected studies on resilience -- Definition of resilience -- Teamwork and resilience in the team -- Resilience factors -- Example of process support to promote resilience in the team.  aThis essential provides insights into approaches, procedures and ideas on how resilience, understood as resistance, can be promoted and implemented in a team. Most of the time, these concepts are only applied to individuals. But many of the findings from resilience research can be transferred to teams and even extended. Today, resilience is also playing an increasingly important role in teams: whether it is to strengthen the sense of coherence according to Antonovsky's principle of salutogenesis, or to consider other resilience factors that support team capability.

Its wide-ranging contributions present theoretical and empirical approaches with reference to different domains across disciplines including psychology, education, social sciences, humanities, and engineering. The authors demonstrate how urgent social, environmental, technological, and economic challenges can benefit from individual and community creativity to effect change. In this volume, “culture” refers to sociocultural differences, educational culture, media culture, organizational culture, technological culture, ethnic differences within a culture, and digital culture. Its contributors offer fresh insights on how creativity, innovation, and change can propel us forward and offer hope for the future across these many different forms of culture. They offer both granular studies of creativity and innovation at work in particular contexts and macro-level discussion on how they affect organizational culture, the culture of a discipline and society at large. This cross-cultural analysis of creativity, innovation and approaches to change will particularly appeal to practitioners and researchers in the fields of psychology, organizational behavior and education.

Affectivity and Learning: Why we need an interdisciplinary, multilevel, and a first-third-person approach?.  aThis book presents an interdisciplinary approach to the study of affectivity and human learning by bridging the gap between neuroscience, cultural and cognitive psychology. It brings together studies that go beyond the focus on cognitive-intellectual variables involved in learning processes and incorporate the study of the role played by affectivity and emotions in learning not only at educational settings but in all processes of transformation and human development, thus presenting affectivity as a catalyst and mediator of all daily learning processes. Chapters brought together in this contributed volume present both theoretical contributions and results of empirical research from different disciplines, such as neuroscience, cognitive psychology, cultural psychology, educational psychology, developmental psychology and philosophy, and are grouped into five thematic sections. The first part of the book brings together chapters discussing different aspects of the role played by affectivity in learning processes from the perspectives of cultural, educational and developmental psychology. The second part is dedicated to the role of affectivity for teachers during their training as educators and during their pedagogical practice in diverse contexts. The third part focuses on the relationship between affectivity and learning from a neuroscientific point of view. The fourth part discusses affectivity and learning in therapeutic and clinical contexts. Finally, the fifth part brings together chapters about affectivity and learning in everyday life. By bringing together this rich interdisciplinary collection of studies, Affectivity and Learning: Bridging the Gap Between Neurosciences, Cultural and Cognitive Psychology will be a valuable resource for researchers in the fields of psychology, neuroscience and education, as well as for educators and teachers interested in knowing more about the relationship between affectivity and human learning. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aSocial psychology. 0aEducational psychology. 0aCognitive neuroscience. 0aLearning, Psychology of. 0aEmotions.14aCognitive Psychology.24aCultural  Psychology.24aEducational Psychology.24aCognitive Neuroscience.24aLearning Psychology.24aEmotion.1 aFossa, Pablo.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aCortés-Rivera, Cristian.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131708808iPrinted edition:z978303131710108iPrinted edition:z978303131711840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31709-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04148nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201072001500224082001500239245011600254250001800370264007500388300006700463336002600530337002600556338003600582347002400618490007700642505038500719520182901104650002802933650002802961650002102989650004403010650002803054650002103082700008003103710003403183773002603217776003603243776003603279776003603315830007703351856004603428912001403474912001503488950006103503950006603564978-3-031-20910-9DE-He21320230801090615.0cr nn 008mamaa230801s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312091099978-3-031-20910-97 a10.1007/978-3-031-20910-92doi 4aR856-857 7aMQW2bicssc 7aTEC0590002bisacsh 7aMQW2thema04a610.2822310aIntracranial EEGh[electronic resource] :bA Guide for Cognitive Neuroscientists /cedited by Nikolai Axmacher.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXX, 906 p. 183 illus., 172 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aStudies in Neuroscience, Psychology and Behavioral Economics,x2196-66130 aChapter 1: Which epilepsy patients are implanted with iEEG electrodes -- Chapter 2: Which is the cognitive status of epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial presurgical studies, and what influences it? -- Chapter 3: (How) does epileptic activity influence cognitive functioning? -- Chapter 4: Which practical issues should I consider when planning and conducting an iEEG study?.  aThis book offers the first, comprehensive guide to planning and conducting intracranial EEG studies, and analyzing intracranial EEG data. The chapters address core questions in the field of intracranial EEG research. They are written by internationally recognized experts in the domain of intracranial EEG and acknowledge the heterogeneity of approaches in this field. The particular format of the book allows readers to find clear guidelines, hands-on expertise and invaluable background information for planning and conducting state-of-the-art intracranial EEG research projects. Besides offering a reference guide to newcomers in the field, it also provides scholarly information for the more experienced researcher and inspiration for the expert. The book covers a wide range of topics, with a special emphasis on aspects in which intracranial EEG data differ from other types of data in the cognitive neurosciences. It discusses typical patient characteristics and implantation schemes, ethical issues, and practical considerations for planning and running intracranial EEG experiments. It addresses signal characteristics and the physiological background of oscillatory and non-oscillatory aspects of intracranial EEG signals. It describes complex pre-processing steps such as advantages and disadvantages of different referencing schemes, and how to identify the location of electrodes. In addition, it answers specific questions on data processing, addressing core aspects of statistical analysis, and suggesting guidelines for data presentation. Further, it covers advanced topics such as causal interventions (i.e. deep brain stimulation), acquisition and analysis of single-unit data and multimodal recordings, and discusses important future challenges and opportunities in the field of intracranial EEG research. 0aBiomedical engineering. 0aCognitive neuroscience. 0aNeuropsychology.14aBiomedical Devices and Instrumentation.24aCognitive Neuroscience.24aNeuropsychology.1 aAxmacher, Nikolai.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303120909308iPrinted edition:z978303120911608iPrinted edition:z9783031209123 0aStudies in Neuroscience, Psychology and Behavioral Economics,x2196-661340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20910-9  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04447nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001500242245020100257250001800458264007500476300006500551336002600616337002600642338003600668347002400704505106700728520105801795650003002853650003002883650002102913650002102934650001602955650001902971650002102990650003003011650002103041650003103062650004003093650001903133700007903152700008203231700008003313700008203393710003403475773002603509776003603535776003603571776003603607856004603643912001403689912001503703950006103718950006603779978-3-031-28360-4DE-He21320230801095201.0cr nn 008mamaa230801s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312836049978-3-031-28360-47 a10.1007/978-3-031-28360-42doi 4aRC434.2-574 7aJMP2bicssc 7aPSY0220002bisacsh 7aJMP2thema04a616.8922310aBiopsychosocial Perspectives on Arab Americansh[electronic resource] :bCulture, Development, and Health /cedited by Sylvia C.

In the context of a growing population of Arab Americans, coupled with the current tenure of xenophobia and exposed structural racism in the US, clinical and community practitioners must be attuned to their clients of Arab ancestry, whose experiences, development, and health concerns are distinctly different than that of their White counterparts. This second edition, with its uniquely interwoven sections of culture, psychosocial development, and health and disease, provides a rich overview of timely, critical topics. The audience for the text includes counselors, social workers, psychologists, nurses, psychiatrists, sociologists, and any other public and mental health practitioners, researchers, and policy makers who work with and on behalf of clients and patients of Arab descent. The authors represent a team of leading experts spanning disciplines of sociology, clinical mental health, and community public health. . 0aPsychology, Pathological. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aNeuropsychology. 0aEthnopsychology. 0aPsychology. 0aPublic health.14aPsychopathology.24aDevelopmental Psychology.24aNeuropsychology.24aCross-Cultural Psychology.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aPublic Health.1 aNassar, Sylvia C.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aAjrouch, Kristine J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aDallo, Florence J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aHakim-Larson, Julie.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303128359808iPrinted edition:z978303128361108iPrinted edition:z978303128362840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-28360-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03359nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050002100172072001600193072002300209072001500232082001400247245015300261250001800414264007500432300006400507336002600571337002600597338003600623347002400659505023200683520115800915650002802073650001602101650004002117650002702157650002602184650003102210700007202241700007502313700008302388710003402471773002602505776003602531776003602567776003602603856004602639912001402685912001502699950006102714950006602775978-3-031-31356-1DE-He21320230801090510.0cr nn 008mamaa230801s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313135619978-3-031-31356-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-31356-12doi 4aHF5548.7-5548.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.722310aOrganizational Behaviorh[electronic resource] :bAn evidence-based guide for MBA students /cedited by Ning Hou, James A.

At the MBA Level, students have proven interested and seek further exploration of the concepts learned through college and their personal experiences in the field. As organizations become more diverse, there is a need to discuss and reference updated academic research on all seven major OB topics: Individual differences, motivation, teams, decision making, communication and conflict, leadership, and organizational processes. The book incorporates the post-pandemic perspectives on each topic. Example topics include personal value changes (chapter 2), challenges in motivation (chapter 3), virtual teams (chapter 4), decision making behavior forces during pandemic (chapter 5), zoom communication fatigue (chapter 6), leading in time of crises (chapter 7), and organizational change (chapter 8). This MBA guidebook will help students navigate the rapidly changing work landscape by tapping into some of the fundamental aspects of human behavior, allowing them to approach diverse human interactions from a more personal perspective. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aLeadership.14aWork and Organizational Psychology.24aLeadership Psychology.24aPersonnel Psychology.24aOrganizational Psychology.1 aHou, Ning.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aTan, James A.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aValdez Paez, Gustavo.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131355408iPrinted edition:z978303131357808iPrinted edition:z978303131358540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31356-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04038nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050002100172072001600193072002300209072001500232082001400247100008200261245014300343250001800486264008200504300006500586336002600651337002600677338003600703347002400739505045300763520157501216650002802791650001602819650002602835650003202861650002102893650004002914650002702954650004002981650001603021650003103037650001603068650002103084650003303105710003403138773002603172776003603198776003603234856004603270912001403316912001503330950006103345950006603406978-3-662-65841-3DE-He21320230801181227.0cr nn 008mamaa230801s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836626584139978-3-662-65841-37 a10.1007/978-3-662-65841-32doi 4aHF5548.7-5548.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.72231 aHoffmann, Christoph.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aBrain-adapted Leadershiph[electronic resource] :bEffective Leadership according to Neuropsychological Findings /cby Christoph Hoffmann.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXII, 191 p. 42 illus., 32 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aForeword -- Preface -- 1. introduction -- I.

This book is a must for therapists, Role-Playing Game geeks and all those interested in how storytelling and gaming can be integrated in to therapy." --Ellie Finch, MA, MBACP(Accred), Videogame Therapist, Family Counsellor and Social Worker Daniel Hand is an author, game designer and therapeutic counsellor in private practice. His work has appeared in venues such as Therapy Today and the Popular Culture Psychology series, and he regularly speaks on the uses of gameplay and storytelling in psychotherapy. This book offers an accessible, comprehensive resource to practitioners who wish to incorporate RPGs into their client-work. Tabletop role-playing games, RPGs, have long been associated with various unique emotional, cognitive, and social benefits, but only recently has the term 'RPG Therapy' entered into the mental-health lexicon. Presenting simple game- and storytelling mechanics, and demonstrating how they may be utilized in accordance with specific professional modalities, this supportive guide explores every step of the implementation process, from underlying therapeutic principles to initial creative exercises to actual in-session play, and encourages readers to have confidence in their own imaginative abilities. Written for practitioners of all levels of client- and RPG experience, this groundbreaking and authoritative book provides case examples and practical tools, along with pragmatic and straightforward advice on how to implement this exciting new form of intervention. 0aClient-centered psychotherapy. 0aBehavior therapy. 0aPsychotherapy   . 0aCounseling. 0aClinical psychology.14aPerson-Centered Psychotherapy.24aBehaviorial Therapy.24aTherapeutic Relationship.24aCounseling Psychology.24aClinical Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131739208iPrinted edition:z978303131741540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31740-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05087nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202072001500225082001500240245012900255250001800384264007500402300006500477336002600542337002600568338003600594347002400630505084600654520213101500650002303631650003003654650002603684650002303710650002003733650002303753650003803776650003203814650002603846650002603872650003303898700014303931700007704074710003404151773002604185776003604211776003604247776003604283856004604319912001404365912001504379950006104394950006604455978-3-031-31395-0DE-He21320230824083749.0cr nn 008mamaa230824s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313139509978-3-031-31395-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-31395-02doi 4aLB1027.55 7aJNC2bicssc 7aPSY0040002bisacsh 7aJNC2thema04a370.1522310aCOMPASS and Innovative Education for Students with Autismh[electronic resource] /cedited by Lisa A.

It describes COMPASS as an evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP) versus an evidence-based practice (EBP) and discusses how it informs innovative individualized education program (IEP) goal setting., planning, and implementation through teacher coaching. In addition, the book introduces the common elements necessary for improved teaching plan quality and child goal attainment in maximizing educational outcomes. It also describes the extension of COMPASS to transition-age high school students with autism as well as the integration of current research findings from NIH-funded studies for transition-age youth and professional development and training. Finally, the book explores innovative methods to support the consistent implementation and expansion of COMPASS across school, home, and community settings. It discusses how to integrate classroomwide performance assessment to identify students in need of the focused instruction that COMPASS provides. Key areas of coverage include: Identifying personalized goals and intervention strategies (i.e., EBPs) using an EBPP framework within COMPASS for students with autism. Advances in measurement of IEP quality for transition-age autistic youth Integration of accessible online educational materials necessary to implement COMPASS feasibly when implemented by school consultants and autism trainers Lessons learned from professional development and training of community-based autism school consultants for developing high quality intervention plans. COMPASS IEP goal attainment and fidelity outcomes with face-to-face, telecoaching, and electronic feedback. COMPASS and Innovative Education for Students with Autism is an invaluable resource for educators, clinicians, scientist-practitioners, and therapists as well as researchers, professors, and graduate students in the fields of child and school psychology, behavioral therapy, and social work as well as rehabilitation, special education, speech pathology, and all interrelated disciplines. 0aSchool Psychology. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aOccupational therapy. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aSpeech therapy.14aSchool Psychology.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.24aDevelopmental Disabilities.24aOccupational Therapy.24aClinical Social Work.24aSpeech and Language Therapy.1 aRuble, Lisa A.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0003-4419-24061https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4419-24064edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aMcGrew, John H.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131394308iPrinted edition:z978303131396708iPrinted edition:z978303131397440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31395-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06605nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001900172072001600191072002300207072001500230082001500245245013600260250001800396264007500414300006700489336002600556337002600582338003600608347002400644505366600668520099604334650002505330650001405355650001705369650002505386650001305411650001705424700007805441700007905519700007805598710003405676773003105710776003605741856004605777912001405823912001505837912001505852950006105867950007505928950008406003978-3-031-31547-3DE-He21320230824121512.0cr nn 008mamaa230824s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313154739978-3-031-31547-37 a10.1007/978-3-031-31547-32doi 4aRC466.8-467.97 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922310aHandbook of Anger, Aggression, and Violenceh[electronic resource] /cedited by Colin R.

References.  aThis book is a manual for self-application of the Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (ABCT) protocol, that can be either self-applied by any individual in a psychoeducational context or as a support for a therapeutic process guided by a professional. Compassion therapy is a third-generation psychotherapy that has been used in association with mindfulness in recent years. In particular, attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) is a protocol that can be used in both the general and psychiatric population with the aim of promoting compassion and self-compassion. ABCT is based on attachment theory and, therefore, includes practices to raise awareness and/or address maladaptive aspects, where appropriate, of the attachment styles developed with parents. This process is taught as a form of both compassion and self-compassion in order to improve present-day interpersonal relationships and well-being in general. In the face-to-face group format, ABCT has been demonstrating efficacy and applicability for healthy people and for the treatment of fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders. This book presents a self-applied version of ABCT that operates along the lines of the original model and has been adapted and developed to be fully self-applied via the Internet in 8 sequential modules: Introduction to attachment-based compassion therapy Preparing ourselves for compassion: kind attention Discovering our compassionate world Developing our compassionate world Understanding our relationship with compassion Working on ourselves Understanding the importance of forgiveness Consolidating the practice of compassion The content is presented through texts, pictures, tables and figures, including links to downloadable audio files for formal meditation practices with specific guides and instruction for each meditation.

An Empirical Ethics Approach to Acute Psychiatric Care: Advancing “Situated Suggestions” .  aThe book presents the results of an ethnographic study examining the post-deinstitutionalized organization and provision of acute mental health care in Italy. While the achievements of the “Basaglia law” which imposed the closure of psychiatric hospitals in Italy in 1978 have been well-documented, this book sheds fresh light on its aftermath and possible continuing influence. The author examines two Italian regions – Piedmont and Friuli Venezia Giulia (internationally known to be the first Italian region to close down asylums) – respectively as representatives of the ‘restraint’ and ‘no-restraint’ models. Within each context, participant observation and discursive interviews have been conducted in Mental Health Centres (CSM) and acute psychiatric wards (SPDC) to explore care and coercive practices, as well as notions of ‘good care’ and values embedded in everyday working activities of these services. Situated suggestions for possible improvement of today’s acute mental health care are also proposed. This book offers a novel ethnography of mental health care in the Italian context that will appeal in particular to practitioners and scholars in the fields of critical mental health, cross-cultural psychology, the history of psychiatry and the sociology of health. Eleonora Rossero is a researcher in the field of the sociology of health, particularlymental health, as she works closely with healthcare services and professionals. Dr Rossero has published previously on the impact of Covid-19 on Italian mental health services, narratives of autoimmune diseases, psychiatric coercive interventions, and Italian de-institutionalization practices and cultures. 0aMental illness. 0aPsychology, Pathological. 0aMental health. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aEthnology.14aMental Disorder.24aPsychopathology.24aMental Health.24aClinical Social Work.24aEthnography.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303134417608iPrinted edition:z978303134419008iPrinted edition:z978303134420640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-34418-3  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04742nam a22006135i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245020400255250001800459264006900477300006500546336002600611337002600637338003600663347002400699490006800723505092400791520142001715650003003135650001503165650001903180650002103199650002303220650001903243650003003262650004203292650003803334650003103372650002603403650001903429700007603448700008503524700008103609710003403690773002603724776003603750776003603786776003603822830006803858856004603926912001403972912001503986950006104001950006604062978-3-031-38977-1DE-He21320230830131929.0cr nn 008mamaa230830s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313897719978-3-031-38977-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-38977-12doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aIdentity as Resilience in Minoritized Communitiesh[electronic resource] :bStrengths-Based Approaches to Research and Practice /cedited by Julie M.

Final Thoughts: Explaining Ideological Possession.  aThis book explores how our temperamental proclivities interact with our political leanings, shedding light on why people perceive the world differently. Focusing on the Five Factor Model of personality, currently the most popular framework in psychology research, the text unpacks the literature on the association between political orientations and personality traits. While only part of the puzzle, growing evidence suggests personality traits have a significant impact on our political convictions and voting patterns. In some instances, certain traits may even make individuals more prone to holding authoritarian and prejudicial views. Understanding these dynamics can help people better navigate political differences and conflicts, and will be of interest to students of personality psychology and students of political ideologies. Ben F. Cotterill is a Lecturer in Psychology at Clemson University in South Carolina, USA. He teaches courses on personality and forensic psychology.

Lessons for future research in dementia.0 aOpen Access  aThis open access book explores the expectations surrounding dementia, what it ‘looks like’ and how people have been treated by others. It aims to raise awareness of the different types of dementia, and how they impact the brain, body, and lived experience, including experience of Alzheimer’s disease, Vascular Dementia, Posterior Cortical Atrophy, Frontotemporal Dementia, Semantic Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia. The co-authors reflect on their experience with informal and formal care, before finishing with a focus on the spectrum of dementia research from clinical trials to user-led research. Throughout the book, co-authors have shared personal stories of how dementia has affected them and people with lived experience of dementia share what they wish people knew about living with the disease. Co-produced by people with lived experience of dementia, academics and health care professionals, this book is an accessible resource about dementia from the perspective of people actively involved in the field and essential reading for healthcare professionals wishing to learn more about the experience of this neuroprogressive condition, as well as policymakers, and members of the public. Dr Rosie Ashworth leads Partners in Research for NRS Neuroprogressive and Dementia Network, UK. As a research psychologist, Rosie is passionate about co-production, ethics, and actively involving people with lived experience in research.

Covid-19 and Older People: A Global Discourse of Stigmatization -- Chapter 5. Unmasked: Remarks on the Coronization of Culture.  aAge into Race is a socio-anthropological essay on the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic on the cultural status of the old. As the worldwide horrors of the Corona era have since been publicly repressed, the text is geared to revisit and relive the tenor of that time while considering its latent revolutionary aftermath. There was wide agreement that Covid-19 policies targeted older people as a risk group in need of protection, setting it apart from the rest of society. Yet, paradoxically, long-term facilities for older people effectively became Covid-19 death traps. What kind of abandonment propelled this apparent contradiction? This book provides an answer by looking at ageist practices regarding Covid-19 triaging, lockdowns and distancing that affected older people around the world, devising Covid-19 as an inevitable "problem of the elderly" and, by implication, instating and categorizing "the elderly" as a public problem to be bio-politically managed and wrought. The Covid-19 pandemic and its concomitant "state of emergency" triggered an accelerated transmutation of customary ageism into emergent racism, spelling a fatal switch to designating the old as bearers of "bare" life unworthy of human living, thus turning old age from a seemingly cultural category to a socially fabricated viral menace of nature. The book tracks down the process through which the "Coronization" of culture legitimized and impelled a further stigmatization of old age beyond mere ageism to sheer racism. Thus, this transmutation, while compromising their autonomy and subjectivity via imposed lockdowns, social isolation, excommunication and selective discrimination rendered the old a race apart. Subsequently, the moral panic invoked by the specter of the pandemic transformed the social perceptions of later life from a containable social problem to an unbridled public hazard that summoned total measures presented as bureaucratically regimented regulations that dehumanized its victims with impunity. 0aPsychology. 0aClinical health psychology. 0aAge distribution (Demography). 0aGerontology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aHealth Psychology.24aAging Population.24aGerontology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303140668308iPrinted edition:z978303140670608iPrinted edition:z9783031406713 0aInternational Perspectives on Aging,x2197-585X ;v3840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-40669-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06224nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001000172072001600182072002300198072001500221082001500236082001400251245020200265250001800467264007500485300006500560336002600625337002600651338003600677347002400713505138500737520233602122650002304458650002704481650001504508650001904523650001604542650002604558650002704584650004204611650002704653700014904680700014804829700015104977700014805128710003405276773002605310776003605336776003605372776003605408856004605444912001405490912001505504950006105519950006605580978-3-031-13686-3DE-He21320221031111439.0cr nn 008mamaa221031s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311368639978-3-031-13686-37 a10.1007/978-3-031-13686-32doi 4aRC455 7aMMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0070002bisacsh 7aMKM2thema04a616.8922304a362.222310aSocial Work Practice with Fathersh[electronic resource] :bEngagement, Assessment, and Intervention /cedited by Jennifer L.

Father-inclusive readings and resources are also limited. Drawing on the expertise of well-regarded research and practice experts in the field, this comprehensive book provides guidance to social work practitioners and researchers on how to engage, assess, and serve fathers. Instructors can use the text to include fathers in courses on the human behavior and social environment, family systems, clinical practice, diversity, or service systems. Social service systems, unfortunately, have often struggled to positively engage men as parents. Recent demographic trends indicate that fathers are providing more direct care to children and single-father households are one of the most rapidly growing demographic groups in the United States. Barriers to their successful engagement include biases and assumptions about men and fathers, a lack of father-friendly policies and practices in the field, limited training on how to work with fathers, and relatively limited father-inclusive social work research until recently. This book addresses these barriers. It is a guide to social workers in their efforts to better serve men as parents, and does so from an ecological and systems perspective. Multiple case examples and practical tools are provided, as well as specific content on major social service systems. Topics explored include: Father Engagement Organizational “Father Friendly” Assessments Interventions with Fathers Setting the Course for Future Theory, Research, and Practice with Fathers Social Work Practice with Fathers: Engagement, Assessment, and Intervention is a book that could be folded into foundation courses in social work or used by practitioners in the field. It is an essential text for graduate students in social work, psychology, sociology, child development, allied health, and similar disciplines and professions, and a go-to resource for helping professionals/practitioners such as social workers, psychologists, and licensed professional counselors. Advanced undergraduate students in these disciplines and professions also will find the text useful in their studies and work. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aSocial work education. 0aSociology. 0aSocial groups. 0aCounseling.14aClinical Social Work.24aSocial Work Education.24aSociology of Family, Youth and Aging.24aCounseling Psychology.1 aBellamy, Jennifer L.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0001-8912-57041https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8912-57044edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aLemmons, Brianna P.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0003-4554-03961https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4554-03964edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aCryer-Coupet, Qiana R.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-4537-07991https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4537-07994edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aShadik, Jennifer A.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-7164-40521https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7164-40524edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303113685608iPrinted edition:z978303113687008iPrinted edition:z978303113688740uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-13686-3  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04271nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001500242245016400257250001800421264007500439300005400514336002600568337002600594338003600620347002400656505096800680520136601648650001603014650001403030650001903044650001603063650002303079650001903102700008603121700009503207700008103302710003403383773002603417776003603443776003603479776003603515856004603551912001403597912001503611950006103626950006603687978-3-031-10698-9DE-He21320230816192651.0cr nn 008mamaa221227s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830311069899978-3-031-10698-97 a10.1007/978-3-031-10698-92doi 4aRC434.2-574 7aMMH2bicssc 7aMED1050002bisacsh 7aMKL2thema04a616.8922310aDigital Mental Healthh[electronic resource] :bA Practitioner's Guide /cedited by Ives Cavalcante Passos, Francisco Diego Rabelo-da-Ponte, Flavio Kapczinski.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIV, 259 p. 16 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1.

Authors synthesize existing literature on the validity of digital health technologies, including smartphones apps, sensors, chatbots and telepsychiatry for mental health disorders. They also note that collecting real-time biological information is usually better than just collect filled-in forms, and that will also mitigate problems related to recall bias in clinical appointments. Limitations such as confidentiality, engagement and retention rates are moreover discussed. Presented in fifteen chapters, the work addresses the following questions: may smartphones and sensors provide more accurate information about patients’ symptoms between clinical appointments, which in turn avoid recall bias? Is there evidence that digital phenotyping could help in clinical decisions in mental health? Is there scientific evidence to support the use of mobile interventions in mental health? Digital Mental Health will help clinicians and researchers, especially psychiatrics and psychologists, to define measures and to determine how to test apps or usefulness, feasibility and efficacy in order to develop a consensus about reliability. These professionals will be armed with the latest evidence as well as prepared to a new age of mental health. 0aPsychiatry. 0aMedicine. 0aMental health.14aPsychiatry.24aClinical Medicine.24aMental Health.1 aPassos, Ives Cavalcante.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aRabelo-da-Ponte, Francisco Diego.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aKapczinski, Flavio.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303110697208iPrinted edition:z978303110699608iPrinted edition:z978303110700940uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10698-9  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03888nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201072001500224082001500239100008100254245016900335250001800504264007600522300006700598336002600665337002600691338003600717347002400753505046300777520165701240650002202897650001502919650002302934650002802957650001502985650002403000710003403024773002603058776003603084776003603120776003603156856004603192912001403238912001503252950006103267950006603328978-3-658-39196-6DE-He21320230217153422.0cr nn 008mamaa230215s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836583919669978-3-658-39196-67 a10.1007/978-3-658-39196-62doi 4aHF5438.4 7aKJS2bicssc 7aBUS0580002bisacsh 7aKJS2thema04a658.812231 aRainsberger, Livia.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Modern Customer – the PHANTOMh[electronic resource] :bCustomers on the Run: How Sales must Respond to Radically New Buying Behavior /cby Livia Rainsberger.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aWiesbaden :bSpringer Fachmedien Wiesbaden :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXIII, 259 p. 38 illus., 34 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aThe 3E world: enthusiasm, rush, simplicity -- The 3I person: incognito, informed, independent -- The new B2B customer, the PHANTOM: passionate, highly informed, autonomous, benefit-oriented, terrorised, opportune, mobile -- The (un)conscious motives of the new B2B customer: Characteristics, behaviour, needs and expectations -- Realigning sales to the modern customer: Positioning and offering, sales models and processes, customer approach and acquisition.  aThis book shows how companies can – and must – adapt their sales strategies and processes to changing customer expectations in times of digital transformation and markets volatility. How can sales address, win and retain the modern customer, an intangible PHANTOM in the digital space? The digital world is characterized by eagerness, ease and enthusiasm. Nowadays, people have unlimited and instant access to manifold information and thus they believe to be knowledgeable, autonomous and independent. As customers, they actively elude traditional sales and marketing on their way to a buying decision – in B2C and B2B alike. To reach these modern customers, companies must synchronize their sales approaches with their customers' decision-making processes and rethink selling. In this context, the author offers a wealth of suggestions with examples and provocative theses.

It provides salespeople with a blueprint for systematic, non-manipulative, structured customer conversations. Why do negotiations sometimes lead to success and other times not? Why do customers either react positively and sometimes or negatively to comparable procedures and decision-making processes? The authors explore all these questions and, using concrete examples from everyday sales practice in conjunction with current findings from brain research, show what kind of communication will ensure your success. They describe how to better interpret the behavior of customers, their typical and individual ways of thinking, and the timing of their decision-making processes. And you will also learn how ethical that the process of selling can be ethical if you base it on the right philosophy, a positive image of humanity as well as respect and appreciation. Then you can simply let customers buy. If you are in sales and want to optimize your communication with existing and potential customers, this is the book for you.

Grounded in an embodied, embedded, and enactive (3e) view of human functioning, this book presents a novel conceptual framework for the study and treatment of mental disorders and explores implications for the tasks of classification, explanation, and treatment. Chapters one to three argue for the central role of conceptualization in the study and treatment of mental disorders. Popular conceptual models are critiqued, including other recent enactive frameworks. Chapters four to seven then present 3e Psychopathology and explore its implications. This includes analysis of both research-based efforts to explain mental disorders, and methods for formulating individual-level explanations in clinical practice. New answers are presented for important questions such as: are mental disorders things we do or get? Are mental disorders defined in nature or are they socially constructed? Are mental disorders the same things across different cultures? And, are mental disorders located in our brains, bodies, or environments? This engaging work offers fresh insights that will appeal to clinicians, researchers, and those with an interest in the philosophy of psychiatry. . 0aPsychology, Pathological. 0aMental health. 0aPsychiatry. 0aPhilosophy of mind. 0aKnowledge, Theory of.14aPsychopathology.24aMental Health.24aPsychiatry.24aPhilosophy of Mind.24aEpistemology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303129163008iPrinted edition:z978303129165408iPrinted edition:z9783031291661 0aPalgrave Studies in the Theory and History of Psychology,x2946-246040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-29164-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03490nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001500186072002300201072001400224082001700238100008400255245015900339250001800498264007600516300004300592336002600635337002600661338003600687347002400723490003600747505041500783520127401198650002302472650003202495650002502527650001402552650002302566650002502589710003402614773002602648776003602674776003602710830003602746856004602782912001402828912001502842950006102857950006602918978-3-658-41643-0DE-He21320230529192806.0cr nn 008mamaa230529s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836584164309978-3-658-41643-07 a10.1007/978-3-658-41643-02doi 4aBF637.P36 7aJM2bicssc 7aBUS1060002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a658.31242231 aPolz-Watzenig, Astrid.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Healing Effect of the Forest in Integrative Therapyh[electronic resource] :bWith Numerous Exercise Examples for Practice /cby Astrid Polz-Watzenig.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aWiesbaden :bSpringer Fachmedien Wiesbaden :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIII, 47 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringer essentials,x2731-31150 aIntroduction -- Aspects of forest life -- Concept of health and illness in integrative therapy -- Anthropology of integrative therapy -- Aspects of corporeality -- The principle of complex mindfulness -- Concrete forms of intervention for forest life from the perspective of complex mindfulness -- Complex mindfulness in forest life - 14 exercises -- The forest on prescription -- Critical reflection - Limits.  aThe healing effects of the forest in integrative therapy are the focus of this book. Special emphasis is placed on teaching active forest life exercises that can be used in therapeutic practice in individual and group settings. In addition, the application as a prescription in the context of therapeutic interventions is demonstrated and the importance of increasing the inclusion of forest life in the case history is clarified. The attitude of complex mindfulness and practical integrative ecopsychosomatics open up possibilities of a care for the world in a time of alienation from nature with a simultaneous longing for nature; commitment to the preservation of nature strengthens an experience of solidarity and is at the same time effective self-care. The author Astrid Polz-Watzenig is a theologian, psychotherapist (integrative therapy) and coach. She is a certified nature park time-out facilitator and breathing and mindfulness teacher of the Vienna Breathing School, heads the Teaching Institute for Marriage and Family Counseling of the Diocese of Graz-Seckau, and is a lecturer at UNI for LIFE at the University of Graz.

Pictures are flat but by printing them in different colours and viewing them through similarly coloured filters (included with the book) they are brought to life either in stereoscopic depth or in rivalry with one another. They are called anaglyphs and all those in the book display the ways in which the eyes interact. Thus, the reader is an integral element in the book and not all readers will see the same things. The history, science and art of binocular vision can be experienced in ways that are not usually available to us and with images made specifically for this book. The study of vision with two eyes was transformed by the invention of stereoscopes in the early 19th century. Anaglyphs are simple forms of stereoscopes that have three possible outcomes from viewing them – with each eye alone to see the monocular images, with both eyes to see them in stereoscopic depth or rivalry, or without the red/cyan glasses where they can have an appeal independent of the binocularity they encompass. Through the binocular pictures and the words that accompany them there will be an appreciation of just how remarkable the processes are that yield binocular singleness and depth. Moreover, the opportunities for expressing these processes are explored with many examples of truly binocular art. 0aSignal processing. 0aMathematics. 0aScience. 0aLife sciences. 0aSocial sciences. 0aHumanities. 0aEngineering.14aDigital and Analog Signal Processing.24aMathematics and Computing.24aPhysical Sciences.24aLife Sciences.24aHumanities and Social Sciences.24aTechnology and Engineering.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303077994808iPrinted edition:z978303077996208iPrinted edition:z9783030779979 0aVision, Illusion and Perception,x2365-7480 ;v340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77995-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04598nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201072001600224082001400240100008200254245016200336250001800498264008200516300006500598336002600663337002600689338003600715347002400751505052400775520200401299650003003303650001603333650001603349650002303365650002203388650002603410650002703436650004003463650002703503650002303530650002103553650004403574700008003618710003403698773002603732776003603758776003603794856004603830912001403876912001503890950006103905950006603966978-3-662-66032-4DE-He21320230605120542.0cr nn 008mamaa230605s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836626603249978-3-662-66032-47 a10.1007/978-3-662-66032-42doi 4aQ223-227 7aJFD2bicssc 7aSOC0260002bisacsh 7aJBCT2thema04a501.42231 aHümmler, Holm Gero.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aFact and Prejudiceh[electronic resource] :bHow to Communicate with Esoterics, Fanatics and Conspiracy Believers /cby Holm Gero Hümmler, Ulrike Schiesser.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIX, 232 p. 18 illus., 15 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aPart I: Basics -- Introduction -- Why do they believe that?

Part III: Practical tips -- Phrases you hear over and over again -- Practical tips.  aEverywhere you encounter conspiracy myths, superstition, esotericism, pseudoscience and Co. and you want to respond to them - while remaining as factual as possible, clarify your point of view, provide facts, but also not unnecessarily provoke or overload. In addition, you do not want to hurt your counterpart, but to encourage him to rethink. But how do you do that? If you are asking yourself this question, read "Fact and Prejudice". Understand why we are driven by emotions and most information bounces off us. Read experiences and tips from interviews with professional (science) communicators. Then follow different people through their own rethinking processes: What convinces an alternative medicine practitioner to leave non-evidence-based medicine behind? What was the deciding factor for a former vaccination opponent to have her children vaccinated after all? What helps members of appropriative organizations to get out? What moves a celebrated medium to break away from esotericism? This book is for anyone who worries about or doesn't know how to communicate with people who have irrational worldviews - whether it's with family, friends, anonymously on the Internet, or at work. The authors give concrete tips on discussions and situations, and also help you decide when it's important to engage and when it's better to withdraw. Holm Hümmler studied physics and completed his doctorate at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich. After longer research stays at CERN, among others, he now works independently as a management consultant. Among other things, he is involved in the skeptics' organization GWUP with lectures and articles. Ulrike Schiesser studied psychology at the University of Vienna and accompanies people through processes of rethinking and change at the Austrian Federal Agency for Sectarian Issues. She is an expert for conflicts in the field of esotericism, for personality cults, authoritarian and appropriating group structures and conspiracy theories. 0aCommunication in science. 0aPsychology. 0aCounseling. 0aSocial psychology. 0aMedical sciences. 0aAlternative medicine.14aScience Communication.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCounseling Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.24aHealth Sciences.24aComplementary and Alternative Medicine.1 aSchiesser, Ulrike.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978366266031708iPrinted edition:z978366266033140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-66032-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03880nam a22005895i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007500248245014000323250001800463264007500481300003300556336002600589337002600615338003600641347002400677490006800701505074600769520104701515650001602562650003102578650001902609650001602628650001702644650002502661650004002686650002702726650001902753650002702772650002502799650002802824710003402852773002602886776003602912776003602948776003602984830006803020856004603088912001403134912001503148950006103163950006603224978-3-031-31197-0DE-He21320230606085028.0cr nn 008mamaa230606s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313119709978-3-031-31197-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-31197-02doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aDege, Martin.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aAction Research and Critical Psychologyh[electronic resource] :bAn Investigation of Subjectivity and Participation /cby Martin Dege.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aIX, 211 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aTheory and History in the Human and Social Sciences,x2523-86710 aChapter 1.

New grounds for Action Research?.  aThis book examines the theoretical developments in the field of Action Research from a historical perspective. The central focus of the investigation is the concepts of democracy and subjectivity as defined by the field’s various traditions. To address this issue, this book offers a thorough investigation of the theoretical and historical underpinnings of Action Research in order to argue that such a clarification allows for a transcendence of the distinction between theory and practice in political action. This transcendence will be achieved with the theories of the German critical psychologist Klaus Holzkamp and his interpretation of subjectivity and democracy. Holzkamp establishes a comprehensive mode of change based on the contradiction of existing possibilities for action and restrictions in a concretely given empirical situation. This book is aimed at History of Psychology Classes, Social Workers, Activism Researchers, Undergraduate Courses in Critical Thinking and Political Action, and Decolonial Theory in Psychology. 0aPsychology. 0aSocial sciences—History. 0aAction theory. 0aPhilosophy. 0aMethodology. 0aCritical psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aHistory of Psychology.24aAction Theory.24aPhilosophical Methods.24aCritical Psychology.24aTheoretical Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131196308iPrinted edition:z978303131198708iPrinted edition:z9783031311994 0aTheory and History in the Human and Social Sciences,x2523-867140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31197-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04859nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245016700255250001800422264007500440300004400515336002600559337002600585338003600611347002400647490005600671505137800727520140802105650003003513650002303543650002303566650001903589650001603608650003003624650002303654650003803677650002603715650001903741650001603760700007903776710003403855773002603889776003603915776003603951776003603987830005604023856004604079912001404125912001504139950006104154950006604215978-3-031-27587-6DE-He21320230607151920.0cr nn 008mamaa230607s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312758769978-3-031-27587-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-27587-62doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aHandbook of Applied Behavior Analysis for Children with Autismh[electronic resource] :bClinical Guide to Assessment and Treatment /cedited by Johnny L.

It synthesizes the most current research data and trends with best-practice interventions to form a comprehensive, state-of-the-art resource. The handbook reviews ABA research and practices in depth and identifies the interventions most relevant to children across the autism spectrum. Key areas of coverage include: Foundations of applied behavior analysis. ABA treatments for disorders comorbid with autism spectrum disorder. Functional assessment for children with autism. Operational definitions as well as observing and recording data for children with autism. The relationship of measures of psychopathology and applied behavior analysis. Transitioning across tasks for children with autism, including toe walking, feeding problems, and self-help issues. Anxiety, depression, and ADHD in children with autism. The Handbook of Applied Behavior Analysis for Children with Autism is an essential reference for researchers, clinicians and graduate students as well as clinicians, therapists, and other practitioners across such interrelated disciplines as clinical child, school, and developmental psychology, child and adolescent psychiatry, social work, rehabilitation medicine/therapy, pediatrics, and special education. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSchool Psychology. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aPublic health. 0aPediatrics.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aSchool Psychology.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.24aClinical Social Work.24aPublic Health.24aPediatrics.1 aMatson, Johnny L.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303127586908iPrinted edition:z978303127588308iPrinted edition:z9783031275890 0aAutism and Child Psychopathology Series,x2192-923840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27587-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04936nam a22004695i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245014900248250001800397264007500415300006300490336002600553337002600579338003600605347002400641505073600665520240001401650001603801650004003817700008003857700008103937700007804018710003404096773002604130776003604156776003604192776003604228856004604264912001404310912001504324950006104339950006604400978-3-031-27580-7DE-He21320230608153233.0cr nn 008mamaa230608s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312758079978-3-031-27580-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-27580-72doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aPandemic Providersh[electronic resource] :bPsychologists Respond to Covid /cedited by Charles R.

The book’s editors and chapter authors are skilled professionals who had to work their way through uncharted territories, creating a roadmap for the intrepid practitioners who are dealing not only with the current health crisis but also for those who will deal with pandemics yet to come. It is written in a lively, reader-friendly manner that allows its insights to be put to immediate use. —Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., Affiliated Distinguished Faculty, California Institute of Integral Studies. Co-author Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: Biography of a Disease The sudden onset of the pandemic left many psychologists unprepared for the traumas caused by complex and new challenges. This group of psychologists, led by experts from the trauma division of the American Psychological Association, grew into a multidisciplinary group of volunteers who dedicated themselves to learning to address these challenges and to document their learning so that other healthcare providers could benefit. The result is a valuable record of those challenges and lessons learned from multiple perspectives, international affiliates, and creative new methods. The world needs caregivers who can meet the rapidly changing challenges, and this book can help teach and train others to do so. I highly recommend it for graduate students, volunteers, and healthcare providers. —﻿Philip G.

Its coverage spans a broad range of topics, exploring the history and foundations of clinical child psychology as well as the discipline’s theories, research base, ethical and legal implications, and diagnostic systems, including the NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). The handbook examines family risk factors for children (e.g., parental stress, divorce, and depression) and provides leading-edge reviews of cognitive variables (e.g., theories of memory, executive function, theories of intelligence, theory of mind and cognitive tempo). In addition, it describes methods of assessment, including checklists, interviews, and methods of treatment (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy, mindfulness, and family therapy). Chapters focus on assessment of specific diagnostic categories, such as depression, anxiety, selective mutism, ADHD, and pediatric topics, including chronic pain, childhood cancer, childhood obesity, and toilet training. Finally, the book addresses such emerging issues as gender diversity, social justice, cyberbullying, internet gaming disorder and the impact of COVID-19. Key areas of coverage include: Foundations of clinical child psychology. Cognition and clinical child psychology. Testing, assessment, and treatment methods in child psychology. Neurodevelopmental and pediatric disorders in childhood. Assessment and treatments for challenging behaviors in children. Assessment and treatments for psychopathologies in children. The Handbook of Clinical Child Psychology is a must-have resource for researchers, professors, graduate students, clinicians, therapists, and professionals in clinical child and school psychology, child and adolescent psychiatry, social work, public health, pediatrics as well as special education, developmental psychology, nursing, and all interrelated disciplines. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSchool Psychology. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aPublic health. 0aPediatrics.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.24aSchool Psychology.24aClinical Social Work.24aPublic Health.24aPediatrics.1 aMatson, Johnny L.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303124925908iPrinted edition:z978303124927308iPrinted edition:z9783031249280 0aAutism and Child Psychopathology Series,x2192-923840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24926-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05533nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001400242245015800256250001800414264007500432300004400507336002600551337002600577338003600603347002400639505158300663520195002246650002204196650001604218650002504234650002604259650001904285650004004304650002704344650002504371650002604396650001904422700008904441700007904530710003404609773002604643776003604669776003604705776003604741856004604777912001404823912001504837950006104852950006604913978-3-031-30644-0DE-He21320230612101851.0cr nn 008mamaa230612s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313064409978-3-031-30644-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-30644-02doi 4aBF692-692.5 7aJMG2bicssc 7aSOC0320002bisacsh 7aJMG2thema04a155.322310aLGBTQ+ Affirmative Psychological Interventionsh[electronic resource] :bA Latine/x Perspective /cedited by Reynel Alexander Chaparro, Roberto L.

LGBTQI+ Research and Affirmative Psychological Interventions in Puerto Rico.  aThis book presents descriptions of interventions, results of empirical research, and theoretical contributions developed by Latine/x psychologists based on affirmative approaches aimed at promoting acceptance and understanding of LGBTIQ+ people. Contributions in this volume bring together the work of Latine/x scholars, practitioners, and activists across five Latin American countries or territories (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Puerto Rico) and in the United States, in an effort to provide multicultural perspectives to LGBTIQ+ affirmative psychological interventions that highlight local, regional and national particularities. Chapters in this volume go beyond contributions made by applied psychology fields (e.g., clinical and counselling psychology), where affirmative orientations are predominantly located, and include contributions from other fields of psychological research such as social and community psychology. The book is divided in two parts. Chapters in the first part focus on the experiences of trans and gender non-conforming people, with emphasis on contemporary systemic issues that affect gender identity among Latine/x communities and those who do not conform to hegemonic narratives about gender. Chapters in the second part focus on sexual identity among Latine/x LGBTIQ+ people and their families and communities. Contributions in this part present discussions about sexual orientation (grouped in LG/LGB identities), sex and gender dissidence, and the inclusion of intersex. LGBTQ+ Affirmative Psychological Interventions: A Latine/x Perspective will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners in different fields of psychology – such as clinical, counselling, social, and community psychology – interested in a multicultural perspective to understand and develop LGBTQ+ affirmative actions to fight against the repathologization of individuals, groups, families and diverse communities. 0aSex (Psychology). 0aCounseling. 0aClinical psychology. 0aCommunity psychology. 0aMental health.14aPsychology of Gender and Sexuality.24aCounseling Psychology.24aClinical Psychology.24aCommunity Psychology.24aMental Health.1 aChaparro, Reynel Alexander.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aAbreu, Roberto L.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303130643308iPrinted edition:z978303130645708iPrinted edition:z978303130646440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-30644-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03764nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172072001500187072002300202072001400225082001400239100007600253245009200329250001800421264008500439300004400524336002600568337002600594338003600620347002400656505036900680520139201049650001602441650002502457650001902482650003002501650002202531650003402553650002702587650002502614650002902639650003002668650002202698650002202720700007402742710003402816773002602850776003602876776003602912776003602948856004602984912001403030912001503044950006103059950006603120978-3-031-32122-1DE-He21320230614193813.0cr nn 008mamaa230614s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313212219978-3-031-32122-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-32122-12doi 4aBF636.5-.7 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0280002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a158.32231 aBauman, Sheri.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aMental Health in the Digital Ageh[electronic resource] /cby Sheri Bauman, Ian Rivers.  a2nd ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXIII, 207 p. 4 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1.

Chapters in this contributed volume present both theoretical contributions and results of research carried out with students and teachers from 11 countries (Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, UK and USA) who speak seven different languages: Portuguese, Spanish, English, Italian, French, Dutch and Hebrew. By bringing together research developed in diverse cultural contexts it enriches the debates in the interdisciplinary field of writing studies by analyzing a wide range of topics at the interface between research and educational implications for the teaching and learning of writing by children. The book consists of five parts, each one addressing a specific set of topics. Part I presents studies on topics related to written language representation systems (phonological and morphological awareness) and on the relationship between grammar and the quality of texts of different genres. Part II includes studies related to compositional processes of writing texts, and the factors involved in these processes. Part III focuses on the difficulties faced by students during the acquisition and development of writing. Part IV is dedicated to chapters that discuss and compare writing practices in different social environments. Finally, chapters in part V deal with teaching and learning of writing in the school setting. Development of Writing Skills in Children in Diverse Cultural Contexts: Contributions to Teaching and Learning will be of interest to researchers and students in the fields of psychology, education and linguistics, as well as to other social scientists in the broader interdisciplinary field of writing studies. 0aEducational psychology. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aPenmanship. 0aEducation. 0aChildren.14aEducational Psychology.24aDevelopmental Psychology.24aWriting Skills.24aChildhood Education.1 aSpinillo, Alina Galvão.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aSotomayor, Carmen.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303129285908iPrinted edition:z978303129287308iPrinted edition:z978303129288040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-29286-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04708nam a22005895i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001700188072002300205072001600228082001700244245015100261250001800412264007500430300004300505336002600548337002600574338003600600347002400636490005400660505078700714520169101501650002503192650003903217650002803256650002503284650001903309650002303328650001903351650003103370650002803401650002503429650001903454650002603473700014603499700008503645710003403730773002603764776003603790776003603826830005403862856004603916912001403962912001503976950006103991950006604052978-3-031-29995-7DE-He21320230619134013.0cr nn 008mamaa230619s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312999579978-3-031-29995-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-29995-72doi 4aRC475-489.2 7aMMJT2bicssc 7aPSY0280002bisacsh 7aMKMT2thema04a616.891422310aSociocultural Trauma and Well-Being in Eastern European Family Therapyh[electronic resource] /cedited by Tatiana Glebova, Carmen Knudson-Martin.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIX, 122 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aAFTA SpringerBriefs in Family Therapy,x2196-55360 aChapter 1.

Chapters employ a systemic perspective to explore the unique social, political, and cultural contexts that influence relationships in each country with a particular focus on implications for psychological and relational well-being. The volume demonstrates the importance of examining the cultural and sociocontextual nuances and complexity that may influence the impact of historical events on relationships, elucidating similarities and differences among countries in how the collective trauma has influenced them. It assists family therapists and other mental health practitioners in recognizing cultural and social factors that may influence their work with families, individuals, or couples living in these countries or who have immigrated from them. Key areas of coverage include: Descriptions of each country’s experience of sociocultural trauma and the current social-cultural-economic-political contexts. Impact of trauma on interpersonal relationships across various social locations and national and ethnic identities within the existing borders. Current challenges, recommendations for clinical practice, and future directions for research and practice. Sociocultural Trauma and Well-Being in Eastern European Family Therapy is an essential resource for clinicians, therapists, and practitioners as well as researchers, professors, and graduate students in family studies, clinical psychology, and public health as well as all interrelated disciplines. 0aPsychotherapy   . 0aSystemic therapy (Family therapy). 0aEducational psychology. 0aClinical psychology. 0aPublic health. 0aSocial psychiatry.14aPsychotherapy.24aSystems or Family Therapy.24aEducational Psychology.24aClinical Psychology.24aPublic Health.24aClinical Social Work.1 aGlebova, Tatiana.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-0360-53181https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0360-53184edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aKnudson-Martin, Carmen.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303129994008iPrinted edition:z9783031299964 0aAFTA SpringerBriefs in Family Therapy,x2196-553640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-29995-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03480nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100014200248245012700390250001800517264007200535300006600607336002600673337002600699338003600725347002400761505032700785520117301112650001602285650001902301650002102320650001802341650002502359650001402384650004002398650001902438650003002457650001802487650002502505650001402530710003402544773002602578776003602604776003602640776003602676856004602712912001402758912001502772950006102787950006602848978-981-99-2703-6DE-He21320230621043606.0cr nn 008mamaa230621s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898199270369978-981-99-2703-67 a10.1007/978-981-99-2703-62doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aPant, Naveen.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0003-3043-36861https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3043-36864aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aSpirituality, Mental Health and Quality of Lifeh[electronic resource] :bPathways in Indian Psychology /cby Naveen Pant.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aSingapore :bSpringer Nature Singapore :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXIII, 145 p. 64 illus., 2 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1.

Indian Psychology of Mind and Mental Health.  aThis book is about spiritual intelligence and its effects on mental health and quality of life. As mental health and related problems are increasing rapidly and have become a matter of great concern, there has not been a unanimous and empirical approach to assess and cure it, due to its divergence or other causes. This book is based on the most developed construct: spiritual intelligence and its effects on mental health and quality of life. Spirituality and its other constructs are one of the most interesting topics nowadays in the area of positive/indigenous/transpersonal psychology and among social/behavioral scientists. This book provides content on spirituality, spiritual intelligence, mental health, and quality of life. The book also attempts to review related literature (whether review or empirical), to have a look at past and current scenarios on spirituality and mental health and quality of life research. Through an exploration of Indian indigenous psychology, this book provides a look at mental health and the mind from an Indian psychological perspective and examines Indian psychology, taking into consideration modern psychological concepts. 0aPsychology. 0aMental health. 0aQuality of life. 0aSpirituality. 0aPositive psychology. 0aReligion.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aMental Health.24aQuality of Life Research.24aSpirituality.24aPositive Psychology.24aReligion.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981992702908iPrinted edition:z978981992704308iPrinted edition:z978981992705040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-2703-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03514nam a22005295i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245017300255250001800428264006900446300003200515336002600547337002600573338003600599347002400635505028600659520136500945650003002310650001902340650001602359650001702375650002902392650003002421650001902451650001602470650004502486700008302531710003402614773002602648776003602674776003602710776003602746856004602782912001402828912001502842950006102857950006602918978-3-031-34382-7DE-He21320230622171006.0cr nn 008mamaa230622s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313438279978-3-031-34382-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-34382-72doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aMediating Role of Social Media on Youth’s Psychological Well-Beingh[electronic resource] :bA Machine-Generated Literature Overview /cedited by Ashwini Kothambikar.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aX, 165 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1.

Mental Health Awareness through social-media.  aThis book is the result of a collaboration between a human editor and an artificial intelligence algorithm to create a machine-generated literature overview of research articles analyzing the mediating role of social media on the psychological wellbeing of youth. It’s a new publication format in which state-of-the-art computer algorithms are applied to select the most relevant articles published in Springer Nature journals and create machine-generated literature reviews by arranging the selected articles in a topical order and creating short summaries of these articles. In this volume, a human counsellor psychologist used the algorithm to explore articles that present results of research about the impacts of social media on the psychological wellbeing of youth. The Internet has always been popular among youth, but during the pandemic it has attracted even more attention since many aspects of life further migrated to the digital world, thus adding substantially to Internet’s ever-increasing popularity. Today, youth spend a majority portion of their time on the Internet and an increasing amount on social media. In such digitally dependent times, this book attempts to provide insights on the positive and negative impact of the Internet and social media on youth mental health, and also provides specific observations on personality traits. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aMental health. 0aWell-being. 0aPersonality. 0aDifference (Psychology).14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aMental Health.24aWell-Being.24aPersonality and Differential Psychology.1 aKothambikar, Ashwini.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303134381008iPrinted edition:z978303134383408iPrinted edition:z978303134384140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-34382-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03076nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001200242245015900254250001800413264007200431300006600503336002600569337002600595338003600621347002400657505013900681520111800820650002301938650001901961650002001980650002302000650001902023650001702042700015302059710003402212773002602246776003602272776003602308776003602344856004602380912001402426912001502440950006102455950006602516978-981-99-1467-8DE-He21320230622142056.0cr nn 008mamaa230622s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898199146789978-981-99-1467-87 a10.1007/978-981-99-1467-82doi 4aHM1001-1281 7aJMH2bicssc 7aPSY0230002bisacsh 7aJMH2thema04a30222310aHandbook on COVID-19 Pandemic and Older Personsh[electronic resource] :bNarratives and Issues from India and Beyond /cedited by Mala Kapur Shankardass.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aSingapore :bSpringer Nature Singapore :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXVII, 646 p. 46 illus., 40 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aIntroduction -- Global Concerns, Specific Issues -- Challenges faced by institutionalised elderly in COVID era -- Country Experiences.  aThis handbook provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on older people across different countries, focusing on important issues affecting ageing societies.

The book builds upon empirically supported foundations of human cognition, but with a focus on applying this knowledge in a manner that can improve human decision-making to enhance safety and performance. It includes explanations of how the human mind processes information, including differences in novice versus expert information processing, and tools to combat various cognitive biases. Explained within the framework of complex adaptive systems, this book builds upon resources developed through the author’s years of combined applied research and graduate teaching and includes chapters on the roles of uncertainty and complexity within scientific research. Finally, the book offers tools that are rooted in empirical research and demonstrated within the context of contemporary, real-world scenarios, with a focus on improving organizational effectiveness through improved strategic decision making and the development of learning cultures within organizations. 0aPsychology. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aCognition. 0aSocial psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCognitive Psychology.24aCognition.24aSocial Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131928008iPrinted edition:z978303131930308iPrinted edition:z978303131931040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31929-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03531nam a22005415i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001600190072002300206072001500229082001700244100016500261245028100426250001800707264007500725300004300800336002600843337002600869338003600895347002400931490004300955520112500998650002302123650001802146650001902164650002402183650001802207650001902225700008902244700009602333700009102429700009202520710003402612773002602646776003602672776003602708830004302744856004602787912001402833912001502847950006102862950006602923978-3-031-33452-8DE-He21320230624095636.0cr nn 008mamaa230624s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313345289978-3-031-33452-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-33452-82doi 4aHF5415.32-.34 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aBUS0160002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a658.83422231 aTreviño Benavides, Teresa Berenice.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0003-4993-37011https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4993-37014aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aSocial Media Addiction in Generation Z Consumersh[electronic resource] :bImplications for Business and Marketing /cby Teresa Berenice Treviño Benavides, Ana Teresa Alcorta Castro, Sofia Alejandra Garza Marichalar, Mariamiranda Peña Cisneros, Elena Catalina Baker Suárez.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aVIII, 53 p. 5 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringerBriefs in Business,x2191-5490  aSocial media has become vital in Generation Z users' daily lives, as they are the most connected group through social media; however, studies have shown the negative side of using social media heavily, particularly loneliness. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the significant growth of social media use with Generation Z users, which has shown to cause negative psychological effects. This book explores the behaviors of Generation Z consumers on various social media platforms (including interaction with brands as well as persons) and, using results from a Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) analysis, explores the potential risks and causes of social media addiction in this generation. In particular, it offers an integrative model to help marketers understand social media addition and ways in which companies and associations can promote a more conscious use of social media by acknowledging that pathological use of social media has negative effects. This book is useful for students, researchers, scholars interested in empirical research on consumer social media use and addiction. 0aConsumer behavior. 0aSocial media. 0aPublic health.14aConsumer Behavior .24aSocial Media.24aPublic Health.1 aAlcorta Castro, Ana Teresa.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aGarza Marichalar, Sofia Alejandra.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aPeña Cisneros, Mariamiranda.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aBaker Suárez, Elena Catalina.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303133451108iPrinted edition:z9783031334535 0aSpringerBriefs in Business,x2191-549040uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-33452-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03090nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100008000248245013900328250001800467264006900485300006200554336002600616337002600642338003600668347002400704490004500728505059200773506001601365520061501381650001601996650002302012650004002035650002302075700008102098710003402179773002602213776003602239776003602275830004502311856004602356912001402402912001502416912001402431950006102445950006602506978-3-031-34706-1DE-He21320230624094220.0cr nn 008mamaa230624s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313470619978-3-031-34706-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-34706-12doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aKulesza, Wojciech.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aSocial Biases During Covid 19h[electronic resource] :bManaging the Anxiety of Uncertainty /cby Wojciech Kulesza, Dariusz Doliński.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXV, 94 p. 11 illus., 3 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-83710 aChapter 1.

It examines how the press and other entities may bias the dissemination of this information, and what may be done to counteract this tendency.

It lays the groundwork for understanding how irrationality becomes a factor. It explores the positive and negative aspects of illusion creating and provides tools for moving more quickly to resolution. 0aPsychology. 0aSocial psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.1 aDoliński, Dariusz.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303134705408iPrinted edition:z9783031347078 0aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-837140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-34706-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aZDB-2-SOB  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04852nam a22005895i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050002100172072001600193072002300209072001500232082001400247100014800261245023200409250001800641264007500659300006400734336002600798337002600824338003600850347002400886505057600910520191701486650002803403650002703431650003903458650002603497650002303523650002403546650004003570650002303610650002603633650002603659650002303685650001903708700008803727700007703815710003403892773002603926776003603952776003603988776003604024856004604060912001404106912001504120950006104135950006604196978-3-031-33034-6DE-He21320230625193554.0cr nn 008mamaa230625s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313303469978-3-031-33034-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-33034-62doi 4aHF5548.7-5548.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.72231 aLichand, Guilherme.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0002-9118-17451https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9118-17454aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aBehavioral Insights for Policy Designh[electronic resource] :bA New Framework for Understanding Wicked Social Problems and Designing Policies for Real Citizens /cby Guilherme Lichand, Amiris de Paula Serdeira, Bruno Rizardi.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXI, 158 p. 69 illus., 43 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aIntroduction -- Motivating the use of behavioral insights -- The rise and the fall of governmental nudge units -- Diagnosing behavioral mechanisms behind public -- Motivating the use of systems thinking -- Embedding behavioral diagnostics within systems thinking -- Augmenting the public management toolkit with behavioral insights: the PRIx framework -- Using behavioral insights in practice -- Best practices in testing behavioral mechanisms -- Designing for heterogeneous types -- Concluding remarks: the future of policy design -- A toolkit for policy teams -- Index.  aThis textbook is an introductory guide to applying behavioral sciences and systemic thinking into public policy design and implementation. It presents an innovative public management toolkit to handle ‘wicked’ social problems – those not very responsive to traditional public policy instruments – by incorporating insights from the behavioral sciences and systemic design in the diagnostics of public problems, based on the motivations and constraints of the ‘real citizen’ – beyond the ideal citizen’s perfectly rational intentions and plans devoid of social context or self-control problems. This volume aims to motivate the inclusion of broader and deeper insights from the behavioral sciences – especially behavioral economics, cognitive psychology, and social psychology – to the repertoire of public managers by introducing new methodologies for diagnosing the root causes behind public problems and for designing effective policies to address them. The new diagnosis tool – the MSI framework (an acronym for Motivation, Self-control, and Inattention problems) –, will help identify new mechanisms underlying social problems or reinterpret known problems based on behavioral insights. The new methodology for policy design – the PRIx framework (an acronym for Pricing policies, Regulatory policies, and Information policies) –, will enrich existing policy tools with such behavioral insights.

Building on Robert J. Sternberg’s previous work, this authoritative volume brings together leading researchers in the field of intelligence, creativity, and wisdom to show the latest advances in this line of research through a selection of 18 chapters. Using a wide range or approaches, including psychological, cognitive, educational, and philosophical perspectives, internationally renowned scholars offer insights into the benefits of re-thinking our understanding of intelligence, creativity, and wisdom, and how they may helpfully be more integrated. This wide-ranging collection will appeal in particular to students and scholars of cognitive, differential, social, developmental, and educational psychology, as well as creativity studies, education, philosophy, and related disciplines.

Key Terms -- Appendix B. Interview Guide.  aThis book explores the nuances of how discriminatory events are viewed by people of color. Based on the authors' research, it seeks to illuminate the contextual and relational variables that influence perception of discrimination. The research suggests that: Ingroup members can perpetuate racist discrimination; Consistent with attribution theory, discrimination by White people is more often attributed to trait rather than situational causes; Consistent with cultural betrayal trauma theory, perceived racist discrimination by ingroup members can be more acutely distressing because it is unexpected. Filling a gap in the microaggression literature, this book provides an in-depth picture of discrimination and what individuals can do to offset the insidious effects of White supremacy. It highlights the importance of centering the experiences of people of color in describing ambiguous social interactions, with greater attention to the context, background, and relationships between perpetrators and targets of racist discrimination. It presents a clear next step in advancing our understanding of the attributes of discrimination. The benefits of comprehensive education and critical consciousness development are emphasized. 0aPsychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.1 aBridges, Ana J.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303133057508iPrinted edition:z9783031330599 0aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-837140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-33058-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03511nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001000172072001600182072002300198072001500221082001200236100008200248245013500330250001800465264008500483300003200568336002600600337002600626338003600652347002400688505027700712520126200989650002602251650002302277650002102300650001602321650003102337650004902368650002302417650002602440650004902466650002102515650002702536650002402563650002402587710003402611773002602645776003602671776003602707856004602743912001402789912001502803950006102818950006602879978-3-031-34681-1DE-He21320230628080050.0cr nn 008mamaa230628s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313468119978-3-031-34681-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-34681-12doi 4aBF201 7aJMR2bicssc 7aPSY0080002bisacsh 7aJMR2thema04a1532231 aMattschey, Jennifer.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Effects of Bilingualism on Non-Linguistic Cognitionh[electronic resource] :bA Historic Perspective /cby Jennifer Mattschey.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aX, 130 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1.

Is Bilingualism Good or Bad?.  aThis book examines a century of research on the relationship between bilingualism and intelligence and relates it to more recent research on bilingualism and executive functioning. In doing so, it highlights how bilingualism research has been understood and used by wider society and its impact on current debates in cognitive science as well as language policy and education. The book probes the correlation between the fact that while early intelligence research suggested a negative effect of bilingualism on intelligence, the so-called “Bilingual Problem”, later research implied a positive effect, “the Bilingual Advantage.” It questions whether the negative consequences that arose from the Bilingual Problem are influencing researchers’ reluctance to let go of the Bilingual Advantage. Findings on both the bilingual ‘advantage’ and ‘disadvantage’ are shown to have suffered from similar methodological problems, with research into the former finding itself at the centre of the ongoing replication crisis in psychology. This book provides fresh insights that will be of particular interest to students and scholars of cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, bilingualism, applied linguistics, education and the history of science. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aPsycholinguistics. 0aMultilingualism. 0aPsychology. 0aSocial sciences—History. 0aLanguage and languages—Study and teaching. 0aScience—History.14aCognitive Psychology.24aPsycholinguistics and Cognitive Lingusitics.24aMultilingualism.24aHistory of Psychology.24aLanguage Education.24aHistory of Science.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303134680408iPrinted edition:z978303134682840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-34681-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03591nam a22005295i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100014900248245010400397250001800501264006900519300006400588336002600652337002600678338003600704347002400740505038900764520121101153650001602364650002302380650001502403650001502418650001002433650004002443650002302483650003702506700014802543710003402691773002602725776003602751776003602787776003602823856004602859912001402905912001502919950006102934950006602995978-3-031-35070-2DE-He21320230629081239.0cr nn 008mamaa230629s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313507029978-3-031-35070-27 a10.1007/978-3-031-35070-22doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aCatellani, Patrizia.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0002-7195-89671https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7195-89674aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Social Psychology of Eatingh[electronic resource] /cby Patrizia Catellani, Valentina Carfora.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIV, 164 p. 29 illus., 1 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1.

The social psychology of eating helps us understand these dimensions and how we can promote healthy and sustainable eating to improve people's wellbeing. What is most important in deciding what we want to eat? What drives people to go vegan? Do we tend to eat more when we are nervous? Does it change our behavior when we sit at the table with others? Why do we put off starting the diet until the next week? How does online and offline communication influence our eating behaviour? Is it possible to help people change their eating habits thanks to artificial intelligence?

In response to the need of a more efficient approach for the treatment of psychological disorders, especially the broad spectrum of anxiety disorders, the PTC psychotherapeutic model was developed. Results of the follow-up studies reported in the present book show that the relapse rate in this model is in its lowest level compared to other psychotherapeutic approaches. Simple nature of the PTC protocol, described within the present book, allows psychotherapists and clinical practitioners to use this newly developed psychotherapy model for the treatment of mental disorders. This newly developed psychotherapy model can be applied to new developments in the field of psychotherapy theory, research, and practice. All psychotherapy associations, psychotherapy societies, psychological associations, psychotherapy societies, healthcare organizations, and academic libraries are likely to be part of the readership of this book. 0aPsychotherapy   . 0aPsychoanalysis. 0aClinical health psychology. 0aSocial psychology.14aPsychotherapy.24aPsychoanalysis.24aHealth Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303127716008iPrinted edition:z978303127718408iPrinted edition:z9783031277191 0aUniversity of Tehran Science and Humanities Series,x2367-110640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27717-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04130nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001700188072002300205072001600228082001600244100007500260245011500335250001800450264008500468300003300553336002600586337002600612338003600638347002400674505015300698520208300851650002002934650002102954650002402975650001002999650001603009650003403025650002003059650002303079650002403102650003203126650001503158650002103173710003403194773002603228776003603254776003603290776003603326856004603362912001403408912001503422950006103437950006603498978-3-031-31828-3DE-He21320230704142725.0cr nn 008mamaa230704s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313182839978-3-031-31828-37 a10.1007/978-3-031-31828-32doi 4aBF173-175.5 7aJMAF2bicssc 7aPSY0260002bisacsh 7aJMAF2thema04a150.1952231 aBinkley, Sam.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aAgainst White Interiorityh[electronic resource] :bA Racial Critique of Therapeutic Reason /cby Sam Binkley.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aIX, 146 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1 Introduction: Race’s Shame -- 2 Whiteness and the New Racial Sensibility -- 3 Shame and White Inwardness -- 4 Guilt’s Capture -- 5 Conclusion.  a“Against White Interiority offers a startling hypothesis: whiteness now demands self-scrutiny in order to question its implied privileges and racism, and such a turn inward bears a striking analogy to the strict inner discipline therapy demands. These techniques of self-scrutiny do not transcend racism but are caught within its very logic. This disturbing and innovative thesis must be read and discussed by anyone interested in the analysis of the culture and politics of our time.” —Professor Eva Illouz, Directrice d'Etudes, EHESS, France “Binkley offers a powerful critique of the emotional coping mechanism of white guilt that continues to paralyze well-meaning, often liberal, white people from actively resisting and dismantling structures of white supremacy. A very timely book.” —Professor Brad Elliott Stone, Loyola Marymount University, USA This book presents a bold critique of the new racial sensibility that has attained global prominence following the police murder of George Floyd. Through a set of managerial and therapeutic discourses, this new sensibility describes the inner racial life of white subjects, inducing them to adopt a therapeutic attitude toward deeply interiorized white emotions and conflicts. In so doing, the new racial sensibility promises to remake whiteness in the image of the self-aware racial ally. However, such an appeal, it is argued, serves the subtle function of the preservation of white racial dispositions, and the reproduction of the very racism it sets out to transform. Adopting a critical lens derived from Michel Foucault’s analysis of sexuality, together with an engagement with sociological, psychoanalytic and phenomenological reflections on shame as a racial affect, a critique of white interiority considers alternative frames through which white anti-racist subjection might be imagined. Sam Binkley is Professor of Sociology at Emerson College, Boston, USA.

Considering the positive reception of this book, Ros Velasco launches the second part, entitled The Contemporary Writer and their Suicide. This time, leading representatives of various disciplines analyze the literary, philosophical, and biographical works of contemporary writers worldwide who attempted to commit suicide or achieved their goal, looking for covert and overt clues about their intentions in their writings. This book aims to continue shedding light on the social and structural causes that lead to suicide and on the suicidal mind, but also to show that people assiduous to writing usually reflect their intentions to commit suicide in their writings, to explain how these frequently veiled intentions can be revealed and interpreted, and to highlight the potential of artistic, philosophical, and autobiographical writing as a tool to detect suicidal ideation and prevent its consummation in vulnerable people. This book analyzes several case studies and their allusions to their contexts and the socio-structural and environmental violence and pressures they suffered, expressions of their will and agency, feelings of dislocation between the individual, reality, and existential alienation, and literary styles, writing techniques, and metaphorical language. 0aPsychology. 0aCommunity psychology. 0aPsychology, Pathological. 0aCulture. 0aPhilosophy and social sciences. 0aLiterature.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCommunity Psychology.24aPsychopathology.24aSociology of Culture.24aPhilosophy of the Social Sciences.24aLiterature.1 aRos Velasco, Josefa.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303128981108iPrinted edition:z978303128983508iPrinted edition:z978303128984240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-28982-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04900nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007900248245011300327250001800440264008200458300005400540336002600594337002600620338003600646347002400682505079900706520214601505650001603651650002103667650002003688650002603708650001703734650002903751650002803780650004003808650002103848650002003869650002603889650004503915650004003960710003404000773002604034776003604060776003604096856004604132912001404178912001504192950006104207950006604268978-3-662-67259-4DE-He21320230707143726.0cr nn 008mamaa230707s2023    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836626725949978-3-662-67259-47 a10.1007/978-3-662-67259-42doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aMensing, Joachim.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aBeautiful SCENTh[electronic resource] :bThe Magical Effect of Perfume on Well-Being /cby Joachim Mensing.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXI, 345 p. 45 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1 Exploring the effects of scent -- Chapter 2 Perfumes in transition -- Chapter 3 The psychology of perfume choice -- Chapter 4 Welcome to neuroperfumery -- Chapter 5 Insider knowledge of perfumery -- Chapter 6 Insider knowledge of the perfume industry and trade -- Chapter 7 Scent online: Storytelling and digital marketing of perfumes -- Chapter 8 Big and small moments in modern perfumery -- Chapter 9 On the way to the future of smelling -- Chapter 10 Scent therapy: fragrances for more joie de vivre -- Chapter 11 Sales psychology of scent consulting -- Chapter 12 Welcome to the experience perfumery -- Chapter 13 Stationary perfumery in transition -- Chapter 14 Perfume trends, international perfume preferences and mentalities -- Chapter 15 The emergence of the modern perfumer.  aThis book will make you a perfume insider.

It takes cultural and transcultural and positive psychology perspectives into consideration and explores the topic of women’s empowerment from diverse stances, across social strata, cultural divides as well as economic and political divisions. It addresses the critique of the overly Western focus of positive psychology on this topic by adopting a transnational and transcultural lens, and by taking non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) samples into in-depth consideration. The chapters therefore focus on women from diverse socio-cultural, political, socio-economic backgrounds and discuss their ways of empowering others and being empowered. They also discuss related positive psychology constructs, such as: coping, resilience, transformation, growth, leadership, creativity, identity development, sustainable action, as well as positive socio-economic, political and eco-sustainable thought and action. The volume as a whole looks at women's leadership as a factor of empowerment. A further fundamental assumption is that women’s empowerment is needed to create a sustainable future at micro-, meso- and macro levels, which presumes safety, peace, ecological considerations, and compassionate leadership. . 0aPositive psychology. 0aSex. 0aEthnopsychology. 0aCulturexStudy and teaching. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aLeadership.14aPositive Psychology.24aGender Studies.24aCross-Cultural Psychology.24aCultural Studies.24aLeadership Psychology.1 aMayer, Claude-Hélène.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-9445-75911https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9445-75914edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aVanderheiden, Elisabeth.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-0781-54351https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0781-54354edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aBraun-Lewensohn, Orna.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-9749-27631https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9749-27634edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aChen, Gila.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aSueda, Kiyoko.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0003-1424-58881https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1424-58884edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aMangolothi, Brightness.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aSafdar, Saba.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aKim, Soyeon.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-7517-25071https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7517-25074edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303125923408iPrinted edition:z978303125925808iPrinted edition:z978303125926540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-25924-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03418nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050000700172072001600179072001600195072002300211072001500234072001500249082001200264100007500276245008500351250001800436264008500454300004300539336002600582337002600608338003600634347002400670505042900694520102501123650001502148650002502163650001602188650003102204650002402235650002102259650003002280650001502310650002502325650002702350650002502377650002302402650002102425710003402446773002602480776003602506776003602542776003602578856004602614912001402660912001502674950006102689950006602750978-3-031-31015-7DE-He21320230708084711.0cr nn 008mamaa230708s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313101579978-3-031-31015-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-31015-72doi 4aHM 7aJHB2bicssc 7aJHB2bicssc 7aSOC0260002bisacsh 7aJHB2thema 7aJHB2thema04a3012231 aWaltz, Mitzi.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aAutismh[electronic resource] :bA Social and Medical History /cby Mitzi Waltz.  a2nd ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXII, 284 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1: A Nameless Difference -- 2: Autism Before and After the Enlightenment -- 3: Workhouses, Asylums, and the Rise of Behavioural Sciences -- 4: The Social Construction of Autism -- 5: From 'Pathological Motherhood' to Refrigerator Mothers -- 6: Bedlam, Behaviourism and Beyond -- 7: Parent Blaming, Parent Power, and the Start of Real Research -- 8: Self-advocacy and the Rise of the Medical Model Footnotes References Index.  aThis expanded second edition of Mitzi Waltz’s Autism: A Social and Medical History offers an in-depth examination of how the condition was perceived before it became a separate area of investigation, and how autism has been conceptualised and treated since. As well as strengthening the existing text, Waltz has added material on a number of topics that have received increased attention since the first edition, including the rise of the anti-vaccination movement, the shift towards genetic and genomic research, and the progress of the autism self-advocacy movement. The author examines these issues through the perspective of what they mean for autistic people, clinicians and society, and looks at the challenges still faced by autistic people.

He shows how it emerged in the 1970s as a new, guided method. Educational role play developed as a BMT-based project that is great fun to use in practice and that can effortlessly transfer desired competencies in a pedagogical sense. This is because, across cultures, play is often about practicing important social skills or also about working through issues or conflicts. The content Types of role play in differentiation to each other The behavior modification based educational role play Practical applications The target groups Psychologists, especially in psychotherapy training settings Teaching staff in primary and secondary schools, especially class teachers and tutors in subjects such as social learning and ethics The author Manfred Günther studied psychology, labour studies/economy and public health. He has been a curative education home psychologist, school emergency psychologist, mediator, lecturer, and youth counselor, and today works as an author and coach.

Office gossip is a phenomenon that is omnipresent in the workplace and experienced by minority employees at all levels within the organization in different ways. Gossip is felt more acutely by minority employees compared to their majority counterparts at certain occupational levels and this book provides an empirical basis for understanding this phenomenon in organizational settings based on the experiences of marginalized workers. The chapters use a variety of research methods to examine various aspects of the experience of office gossip among marginalized employees including: perceptions of diverse groups regarding workplace gossip, workplace gossip within teams, intersectional experiences of employees from racial minority and LGBTQ+ communities and foreign nationals, experiences of managers from racial minority backgrounds, and experiences in specific fields such as sport and healthcare. This book is of interest to students and researchers of diversity studies, organization research, human resource management, and industrial psychology as well as an important resource for corporate leadership and human resource and DEI departments in corporate organizations. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aPersonnel management. 0aDiversity in the workplace. 0aEmployee health promotion.14aOrganizational Psychology.24aHuman Resource Management.24aDiversity Management and Women in Business.24aWork and Organizational Psychology.24aEmployee Health and Wellbeing.1 aM.

Introduction: I Don’t Want to Save Love, nor Do I Want to Get Rid of It -- 2. A Reading of “Analysis Terminable and Interminable” -- 3. The “Rescuing” of Castration -- 4. The Procedure, from Solution to Dissolution.  a“Tal’s book doesn’t propose an answer that would safeguard the status of psychoanalysis but rather a series of paradoxes that undermine its secure status. The end of analysis appears rather as a fantasy, not the traversal of the fantasy but the maintaining of it.” —From the Foreword by Professor Mladen Dolar, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia This book interrogates the “end of analysis” in psychoanalytic thought from Freud to Lacan. It demonstrates that the notions of mourning, renunciation, liquidation of transference, and traversal of fantasy cannot serve as a settlement for the castration complex (i.e., central to neurosis) but are rather prey to the castration complex itself. It shows how psychoanalysis remains incomplete as long as it has not surpassed them as fantasies sustained by psychoanalytic ideology. In other words, it argues that the analytic procedure must pull psychoanalysis out of this therapeutic tradition for it to be complete and to instigate an attempt of its renewal. The book equally revisits Freud’s and Lacan’s underpinnings in the Enlightenment project, in order to formulate the problem of transference on proper dialectical foundations—that is, the mechanism of alienation from Descartes to Hegel, Kierkegaard’s concept of anxiety, as well as the concepts of authority and value in Durkheim, Mauss, and Marx. In doing so, it provides fresh insights that will appeal to practitioners, as well as to scholars of psychoanalysis and philosophy. Mohamed Tal is a Clinical Psychologist and Psychoanalyst; he held a private practice in Beirut, Lebanon, since 2009 and moved to practice in Dubai, UAE, since 2022. He is an affiliate of the Rome Institute, and a member of the Beirut Institute for Critical Analysis and Research (BICAR). Dr Tal has worked as a Psychotherapist with humanitarian organizations in the Middle East, including Doctors Without Borders, WarChild Holland, Handicap International, and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit. He also held a seminar on The Real at the École Libanaise de Psychanalyse from 2018 to 2021. . 0aPsychoanalysis. 0aPhilosophy of mind. 0aPsychology.14aPsychoanalysis.24aPhilosophy of Mind.24aTheoretical Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303129888208iPrinted edition:z978303129890508iPrinted edition:z9783031298912 0aThe Palgrave Lacan Series,x2946-420X40uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-29889-9  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05981nam a22005895i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245011400255250001800369264007500387300004600462336002600508337002600534338003600560347002400596490007600620505173800696520204302434650003004477650001904507650002504526650002604551650001904577650002304596650003004619650003904649650002604688650004204714650001904756650002604775700014404801710003404945773002604979776003605005776003605041776003605077830007605113856004605189912001405235912001505249950006105264950006605325978-3-031-31549-7DE-He21320231003194750.0cr nn 008mamaa230714s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313154979978-3-031-31549-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-31549-72doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aViolence in Familiesh[electronic resource] :bIntegrating Research into Practice /cedited by Peter Sturmey.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXVIII, 466 p. 1 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aAdvances in Preventing and Treating Violence and Aggression,x2946-47650 aPart I.

Contemporary Issues in Healthcare.  aThis book examines the complexities of clinical social work practice in healthcare today. It identifies many of the psychological, social, emotional and spiritual aspects of physical illness in adults. The approach draws on theories from trauma, crisis intervention and supportive counseling, as well as empirical literature from other healthcare fields. Recognizing that social work roles in healthcare range from short-term or crisis-oriented interventions to ongoing, depth-oriented relationships, the authors develop clinical assessment and intervention useful for social workers in various healthcare settings. By utilizing a common frame of clinical analysis, social workers can deepen their critical thinking skills in examining the impacts of specific illnesses and injuries on coping and wellbeing. Each chapter includes an analysis of the psychosocial impacts of the given medical condition across the following spectrums: illness or injury (by onset, course, outcome, and degree of incapacitation) relationship between nature of illness, and emotional and psychosocial functioning common clinical issues, and impacts of historical and current trauma end-of-life and bereavement social justice the authors’ reflections on practice The Practice of Clinical Social Work in Healthcare is an essential guide for MSW students and social work professionals in healthcare. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aSocial work education. 0aMedical care. 0aPsychology.14aClinical Social Work.24aSocial Work Education.24aHealth Care.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.1 aHemphill, Meredith.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aNathanson, Abigail.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303131649408iPrinted edition:z978303131651708iPrinted edition:z9783031316524 0aEssential Clinical Social Work Series,x2520-161140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-31650-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)02657nam a22004455i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007800248245013000326250001800456264007200474300006200546336002600608337002600634338003600660347002400696505028100720520078401001650001601785650004001801710003401841773002601875776003601901776003601937776003601973856004602009912001402055912001502069950006102084950006602145978-981-99-1710-5DE-He21320230717130340.0cr nn 008mamaa230716s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898199171059978-981-99-1710-57 a10.1007/978-981-99-1710-52doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aBurns, Robert B.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut14aThe Human Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemich[electronic resource] :bA Review of International Research /cby Robert B.

The current global pandemic has thrown a diverse set of entwined social, psychological, and economic disruptive impacts of human suffering on societies, groups, and individuals due to the flow on effects of not only the disease itself but massive dislocations of the everyday routines of life driven by mandated restrictions imposed by national governments. This intersecting set of experiences has evoked considerable human distress particularly in the fields of employment, education, healthcare work, and bereavement rituals. This text reviews, from existing knowledge and the research emanating in the last two years from around the world, the issues and problems faced by people and their governments. 0aPsychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981991709908iPrinted edition:z978981991711208iPrinted edition:z978981991712940uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-1710-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06273nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243245019100255250001800446264007500464300004200539336002600581337002600607338003600633347002400669490004000693505225000733520169402983650003004677650002304707650001904730650001904749650001604768650003004784650003804814650002604852650003904878650001904917650001604936700008104952700008005033700014805113710003405261773002605295776003605321776003605357776003605393830004005429856004605469912001405515912001505529950006105544950006605605978-3-031-32597-7DE-He21320230717104514.0cr nn 008mamaa230717s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313259779978-3-031-32597-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-32597-72doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a15522310aHandbook of Adverse Childhood Experiencesh[electronic resource] :bA Framework for Collaborative Health Promotion /cedited by Sharon G.

This book offers a diverse range of perspectives on the practice of financial therapy, exploring its benefits, challenges, and potential critiques. The book also provides practical guidance for financial therapists as well as financial planning and mental health practitioners who incorporate financial therapy into their work. The book covers a wide range of topics, including the neurobiology of financial decision-making, models in financial therapy, online financial therapy, generational differences in financial attitudes, incorporating financial therapy into divorce planning, and techniques for coping with the stresses associated with estate planning. The book addresses the need for culturally relevant assessments of financial therapy in African contexts and offers a critical appraisal of the field of financial therapy. By providing multiple perspectives and practical guidance, this book will be a valuable resource for students, scholars, and researchers in financial therapy, financial planning and related fields, as well as the broader field of psychology. 0aPersonal coaching. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aCounseling. 0aEconomics—Psychological aspects. 0aPsychological consultation.14aCoaching.24aIndustrial Psychology.24aCounseling.24aBehavioral Finance.24aConsulting.1 aSarpong, Prince.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aAlsemgeest, Liezel.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303133361308iPrinted edition:z978303133363708iPrinted edition:z978303133364440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-33362-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04467nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001600184072002300200072001600223082001700239245018200256250001800438264007200456300006400528336002600592337002600618338003600644347002400680505122900704520125601933650002503189650001603214650002503230650001603255700007703271700007803348700008203426700008303508710003403591773002603625776003603651776003603687776003603723856004603759912001403805912001503819950006103834950006603895978-981-99-2637-4DE-He21320230718080014.0cr nn 008mamaa230718s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898199263749978-981-99-2637-47 a10.1007/978-981-99-2637-42doi 4aBF204.6 7aJMA2bicssc 7aPSY0450002bisacsh 7aJMAP2thema04a150.198822310aHandbook of Happinessh[electronic resource] :bReflections and Praxis from Around the World /cedited by Saamdu Chetri, Tanusree Dutta, Manas Kumar Mandal, Priyadarshi Patnaik.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aSingapore :bSpringer Nature Singapore :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXX, 519 p. 23 illus., 10 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aHappiness research in the psychological perspective: Thoughts of an optimist -- Blissful space within and without: Explorations through mandala and vastu -- Self-architecture for sukha: Mind++ for integral wellbeing -- Harmony Theory: Positive Organisation with Philosophical Foundations -- Public health as a paradigm for happiness: Understanding vaccine impact -- Linguistic and cultural exploration of Indian concept of happiness -- Gross National Happiness: The interdependent domains of happiness -- New economy for happiness -- Happiness & hope in education -- Interdisciplinary perspectives on social-ecological wellbeing -- Post-capitalism: Towards social and ecological wellbeing -- The constant of happiness and comparative ecologies -- The economics of happiness: An exploration for guiding principles -- What if Happytalism becomes the next step of human existence -- From Stress to Happiness -- Is there a positive correlation between forgiveness and happiness? -- Happiness: Developing skills for meditation -- A multidisciplinary approach to understanding wellbeing in dying -- Communication, happiness & wellbeing -- The economics of happiness: An experience from Ladakh -- Characteristics of happy people. .  aThis book contains contributions from diverse perspectives and traditions that focus on reflections and happiness practices.

More and more people receive psychiatric diagnoses and the use of psychopharmacological drugs keeps increasing. Concurrently, media report the popularity of “brain doping” or “study drugs” on campuses as well as at the workplace. This open access book tests the hypothesis of whether mental health and enhancement can be seen as two sides of the same coin: that the demands on cognitive and emotional functioning have been increasing and psychoactive substances are used to meet these demands. Whether the increasing number of diagnoses means that really more people are suffering from psychological problems will be discussed just as whether the media accurately describe “brain doping” as a new and rising trend. An individual section describes non-pharmacological alternatives to maintain and increase one’s mental well-being. To answer these and many more questions, the author critically reviews evidence from epidemiology, psychiatry, and psychology. That people with and without psychiatric diagnoses are often using the same substances – for example, the stimulant drugs Adderall or Ritalin – to cope with their problems is presented as evidence to look beyond the traditional distinction between disorder, health, and enhancement. Likewise, different meanings of “drug” in historical and present contexts illustrate that the way we think of mental health and (il)legitimate drug use reflects our own culture. The book’s focus on addiction/substance use disorders makes it also relevant to the ongoing discussion of drug policy. Stephan Schleim is Associate Professor of Theoretical Psychology at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, and author of different books on philosophy, psychology, and the neurosciences. He has also been acting chair in Neurophilosophy at the University of Munich, Germany. He has carried out several research projects on the theory and ethics of neuroscience. The focus of his investigations have been the conditions under which scientific knowledge is created and communicated to the public. 0aSocial psychology. 0aLaw and the social sciences. 0aMental health. 0aPsychology, Pathological. 0aMental illness.14aSocial Psychology.24aSocio-Legal Studies.24aMental Health.24aPsychopathology.24aMental Disorder.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303132617208iPrinted edition:z9783031326196 0aPalgrave Studies in Law, Neuroscience, and Human Behavior,x2946-520640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32618-9  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aZDB-2-SOB  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03079nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172072001600183072002300199072001500222082001500237100008100252245010000333250001800433264006900451300005400520336002600574337002600600338003600626347002400662505043700686520095001123650002502073650002302098650001902121650002602140650002202166650002702188710003402215773002602249776003602275776003602311776003602347856004602383912001402429912001502443950006102458950006602519978-3-031-32886-2DE-He21320230719210709.0cr nn 008mamaa230719s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313288629978-3-031-32886-27 a10.1007/978-3-031-32886-22doi 4aRA1148 7aJMK2bicssc 7aPSY0140002bisacsh 7aJMK2thema04a614.152231 aMeđedović, Janko.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aEvolutionary Behavioral Ecology and Psychopathyh[electronic resource] /cby Janko Međedović.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aVIII, 184 p. 9 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1 Basic concepts of Evolutionary Biology -- Chapter 2 Evolutionary of Behavioral Sciences -- Chapter 3 Evolutionary Ecology of Family -- Chapter 4 Evolutionary Tradeoffs in Human -- Chapter 5 Life History Theory -- Chapter 6 Behavioral Ecology of Personality -- Chapter 7 Psychopathy and its Current Evolution -- Chapter 8 The Empirical Study: Psychopathy, Fertility, Longevity, Interacting Phenotypes, and Parental effects.  aThis book examines the study of psychopathy using behavioral ecological framework. It consists of two parts. The first describes the science of human behavioral ecology, including: • Basic concepts of evolutionary biology • Evolutionary behavioral sciences • Evolutionary ecology of family • Evolutionary tradeoffs • Life history theory • Behavioral ecology of personality • Psychopathy and its current evolution. The second part of the book describes empirical research on psychopathy in evolutionary ecological context, aiming to explore fertility-longevity tradeoffs in psychopathy, interacting phenotypes in psychopathy, and parental effects associated with psychopathy. This part contains the discussion of the study’s findings which is based on several theoretical concepts described in part one. This volume is ideal for psychopathy researchers hoping to bridge the natural and social sciences in a new and innovative way. 0aForensic psychology. 0aForensic sciences. 0aPsychobiology.14aForensic  Psychology.24aForensic Science.24aBiological Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303132885508iPrinted edition:z978303132887908iPrinted edition:z978303132888640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32886-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05307nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245020200248250001800450264007500468300006600543336002600609337002600635338003600661347002400697490005500721505118700776520185001963650001603813650002803829650002303857650002503880650002603905650001603931650004003947650004003987650002304027650002504050650002604075650002104101700007804122700008004200710003404280773002604314776003604340776003604376776003604412830005504448856004604503912001404549912001504563950006104578950006604639978-3-031-29807-3DE-He21320230811191025.0cr nn 008mamaa230811s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312980739978-3-031-29807-37 a10.1007/978-3-031-29807-32doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aFostering Innovation in the Intelligence Communityh[electronic resource] :bScientifically-Informed Solutions to Combat a Dynamic Threat Environment /cedited by Craig W.

Of the potential threats, Ubiquitous Technical Surveillance (UTS) presents one of the most acute generalized vulnerabilities facing the broader Intelligence Community (IC), Department of Defense (DoD), and United States Government. While security systems and networks have attempted to adapt to meet these evolving threats, internal organizational structures, culture, and human behavior often lag behind due to the inherent challenges in changing these dynamic variables. It is crucial that scientific disciplines identify systemic and innovative behavioral countermeasures that are informed by sub-disciplines of the psychology and CS literature. Innovative strategies involve collaboration amongst experts from the domains of social psychology, game theory, Bayesian statistics, and the IC, which will be discussed in-depth. A special issue that pulls from cross-disciplinary professionals will have a broad impact for the IC and DOD eliciting wide readership and spurring needed innovation. ___________________________________________________________________ "Cultivating a culture of innovation, though difficult, is important for any enduring organization. It's downright essential for the US Intelligence Community, which must stay one step ahead of adversaries on surveillance technologies and tradecraft to be effective. This collection of articles brings together insightful research and analysis from diverse domains, moving us closer to the deeper appreciation of innovation and culture that is so urgently needed."

In partnership with the Alice Ruggles Trust, this book draws on a wealth of expert contributions including those with lived experience, frontline services such as Paladin National Stalking Advocacy Service, charities EmilyTest and Hollie Gazzard Trust, researchers of so-called honour-based abuse and online harms, and forensic psychologists who work with people who stalk. It begins with an overview of ways to recognise harmful behaviours, including those carried out online. The discussion then moves on to methods and motivations of stalking and coercive control and the various lifestyle contexts including education environments, young people in the workplace, and the role of the police and frontline support services in tackling these issues. It is a vital resource for undergraduate students across criminology, sociology, law, psychology, education, social justice, policing, and forensic psychology, as well as a combination of academic researchers and professionals working within stalking and domestic abuse support and prevention. This action-orientated book also includes 'Key Points' and ‘Discussion Questions’ in each chapter to direct student learning in the classroom and to create discussion points for wider readers. . 0aJuvenile delinquents. 0aCriminal behavior. 0aForensic psychology. 0aSocial service. 0aVictims of crimes.14aYouth Offending and Juvenile Justice.24aCriminal Behavior.24aForensic  Psychology.24aChildren and Youth Work.24aSocial Care.24aVictimology.1 aMellins, Maria.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aWheatley, Rachael.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aFlowers, Caroline.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303132378208iPrinted edition:z978303132380540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32379-9  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05173nam a22005295i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202072001500225082001500240245015800255250001800413264007500431300006400506336002600570337002600596338003600622347002400658490005300682505126700735520193102002650002303933650001903956650001903975650002303994650001904017650001904036700008304055700008204138710003404220773002604254776003604280776003604316776003604352830005304388856004604441912001404487912001504501950006104516950006604577978-3-031-36608-6DE-He21320230812105637.0cr nn 008mamaa230812s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313660869978-3-031-36608-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-36608-62doi 4aLB1027.55 7aJNC2bicssc 7aPSY0040002bisacsh 7aJNC2thema04a370.1522310aStrengthening Child Safety and Well-Being Through Integrated Data Solutionsh[electronic resource] /cedited by Christian M.

Conclusion and Panel Discussion. .  aThis book explores the use of integrated administrative data to understand and address the significant public health problem of child maltreatment. It examines the use of linked, or integrated, administrative data to increase understanding of population-level needs – and to inform decision-making efforts – within the child welfare system and across other public systems. The book details the technological innovations that have allowed for the accumulation and centralization of large datasets critical to identifying risks of child maltreatment and its negative consequences and to target community and system responses more accurately to address these challenges. Leading experts from the fields of child maltreatment, child welfare, and human services research share their insights and experiences at the forefront of this critical research area and how it is shaping understanding of identification, intervention, and policy affecting children and families. Key areas of coverage include: · Ways in which these data can be leveraged to promote more effective efforts to detect, prevent, and respond to child maltreatment. · Emerging and innovative approaches in the acquisition and use of administrative data to inform the societal and governmental response to child maltreatment. · The use of multisystem data and integrated data systems to conduct predictive analytics, risk monitoring, or policy- and program-focused research and evaluation to inform child welfare system solutions. Strengthening Child Safety and Well-Being Through Integrated Data Solutions is a must-have volume for researchers, professors, and graduate students as well as clinicians, practitioners, policy makers, and related professionals across such disciplines as child and school psychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, public health, clinical social work, educational and public policy, and all related disciplines. . 0aSchool Psychology. 0aBiotechnology. 0aPublic health.14aSchool Psychology.24aBiotechnology.24aPublic Health.1 aConnell, Christian M.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aCrowley, Daniel Max.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303136607908iPrinted edition:z978303136609308iPrinted edition:z9783031366109 0aChild Maltreatment Solutions Network,x2509-716440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36608-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04227nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172072001500187072002300202072001400225082001400239245012800253250001800381264008500399300003500484336002600519337002600545338003600571347002400607490006400631505080500695520133401500650001602834650003902850650002502889650002902914650002702943650003102970650001903001650002703020700007503047700007903122700007403201710003403275773002603309776003603335776003603371830006403407856004603471912001403517912001503531950006103546950006603607978-3-031-30526-9DE-He21320230815133232.0cr nn 008mamaa230815s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313052699978-3-031-30526-97 a10.1007/978-3-031-30526-92doi 4aBF636.5-.7 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0280002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a158.322310aNew Horizons in Systemic Practice with Adultsh[electronic resource] /cedited by Tone Grover, Siv Merete Myra, Ulf Axberg.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXIII, 188 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aPalgrave Texts in Counselling and Psychotherapy,x2662-91350 a1.

Coming Full Circle With the Neuroscience: Using New Theory to Re-understand Therapy.  aThis book explores the various applications of systemic understanding in practice. Each chapter covers diverse working contexts and existential life dilemmas, tackling subjects such as: systemic work with individuals, single session family therapy, experiences of adult longing, the therapeutic relationship as a form of love, working systemically with experiences of marginalisation, cultural difference and diversity, the integration of recent neuroscience developments with systemic therapy with couples, the role of forgiveness and the spiritual dimension in therapy. Throughout, this book promotes hope by presenting new horizons and providing room for reflection on uncertainty, change, opportunities, inter-connections and differences. Theoretical expansion of these existential issues lies both at the heart of systemic work and on the leading edge of research and theory-practice linking, showing how the integration of research with new developments across the broader fields of psychotherapy and counselling can be held within a systemic relational umbrella.

The book starts from a psychological perspective and introduces readers to basic behavioral theories and models that can explain end-user privacy behavior (including the “privacy paradox”) on a theoretical level. Subsequently, an introduction to different study methods (e.g., experiment, survey, interviews, co-creation) used in usable privacy research is given. Based on this, different methodological aspects, such as identifying appropriate questionnaires, and applying User-Centered Design, will be discussed. Finally, the book describes application areas for privacy research such as dark patterns and presents solutions for privacy protection, e.g., regarding consent-giving and PETs. The book aims to bring together the different research approaches to the topic of usable privacy, which often originate from computer science, psychology, and law, and provide a methodologically sound basis for researchers who want to delve deeper into this topic.

It uncovers the impact of far-reaching changes of work and employment, as evidenced by increased flexibility, discontinuity, and technological innovation, and offers insights into recent theoretical and methodological developments addressing this challenge. In its main parts, it presents the best evidence to readers about the following topics: early life influences on (un)healthy work, chronic exposure to occupational risks; nonstandard employment and poor health; work continuation with chronic disease; occupational determinants of healthy aging. In its final part, it discusses policy implications of current knowledge and points to the need of developing new solutions in research and practice, not least in times of climate crisis and the new pandemic. The important handbook has been prepared by a distinguished editorial team, with chapters written by prominent international experts. Despite its continuous reference to scientific knowledge it addresses its content to a broader, non-specialized readership. 0aOccupational health services. 0aSocial medicine. 0aPublic health. 0aMedicine, Industrial. 0aIndustrial sociology. 0aClinical health psychology.14aOccupational Health.24aMedical Sociology.24aPublic Health.24aOccupational Medicine.24aSociology of Work.24aHealth Psychology.1 aWahrendorf, Morten.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aChandola, Tarani.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aDescatha, Alexis.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eReference08iPrinted edition:z9783031304910 0aHandbook Series in Occupational Health Sciences,x2730-741740uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-30492-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXRH  aZDB-2-SXBE  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aReference Module Humanities and Social Sciences (SpringerNature-43749)  aReference Module Business, Economics and Social Sciences (SpringerNature-85196)05070nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243100014500255245015400400250001800554264007500572300004500647336002600692337002600718338003600744347002400780490004600804505089400850520197201744650003003716650002303746650001903769650002503788650003003813650003203843650002603875650001903901650002503920700014303945710003404088773002604122776003604148776003604184776003604220830004604256856004604302912001404348912001504362950006104377950006604438978-3-031-36294-1DE-He21320230822081916.0cr nn 008mamaa230822s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313629419978-3-031-36294-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-36294-12doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a1552231 aNiemiec, Ryan M.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0002-3311-611X1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-611X4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aCharacter Strengths and Abilities Within Disabilitiesh[electronic resource] :bAdvances in Science and Practice /cby Ryan M.

It explores character strengths as positive personality qualities most central to an individual’s identity that create positive outcomes for building well-being and managing adversities and contribute to the collective good. The book recognizes disability as a part of the human experience that can emerge for anyone and the necessity for examining and applying strengths-based approaches. It explores what is known about character strengths and various disabilities from a science and practice perspective. The book reviews research on the assessment, correlations, concepts, populations, and applications of character strengths across disabilities. It disseminates disparate research and little-known best practices and hypothetical practices, along with multiple case examples, in the effort to advance the science and practice, bring a balanced approach to the field, and contribute to human flourishing. Key topics of coverage include: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and character strengths. Intellectual and physical disabilities, medical illness and character strengths. Mental and emotional disorders (e.g., trauma) and character strengths. Character strengths and disability across special issues including justice, inclusion, dual-diagnosis, and spirituality. Understanding character strengths as internal capacities and abilities across disabilities, problems, and suffering. Character Strengths and Abilities Within Disabilities is an essential and valuable resource for researchers, professors, clinicians, practitioners, and therapists as well as graduate students in the fields of developmental and positive psychology, rehabilitation, social work, special education, occupational, speech and language therapy, public health, and healthcare policy. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aPublic health. 0aPositive psychology.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aDevelopmental Disabilities.24aClinical Social Work.24aPublic Health.24aPositive Psychology.1 aTomasulo, Dan.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0002-1428-88051https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1428-88054aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303136293408iPrinted edition:z978303136295808iPrinted edition:z9783031362965 0aPositive Psychology and Disability Series40uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36294-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03762nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001500242245015500257250001800412264007200430300006600502336002600568337002600594338003600620347002400656505117800680520068101858650002902539650004002568650001402608650002602622650002102648650002802669650001402697700007902711700008402790710003402874773002602908776003602934776003602970776003603006856004603042912001403088912001503102950006103117950006603178978-981-19-8749-6DE-He21320230822090307.0cr nn 008mamaa230822s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898119874969978-981-19-8749-67 a10.1007/978-981-19-8749-62doi 4aLB1060-1077 7aJNC2bicssc 7aEDU0090002bisacsh 7aJNC2thema04a370.1522310aCreating Dynamic Places for Learningh[electronic resource] :bAn Evidence Based Design Approach /cedited by Peter C.

Toward this end, this volume explores a multi-disciplinary perspective that draws upon modern learning theories, and empirical research from the fields of environmental psychology education, and architectural practice. By presenting this information in an accessible manner, it enables researchers, educators and designers to take actionable steps needed to re-imagine their settings and create dynamic places for learning. 0aLearning, Psychology of. 0aEducational tests and measurements. 0aTeaching.14aInstructional Theory.24aLearning Theory.24aAssessment and Testing.24aPedagogy.1 aLippman, Peter C.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aMatthews, Elizabeth A.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981198748908iPrinted edition:z978981198750208iPrinted edition:z978981198751940uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-8749-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06134nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050002100172072001600193072002300209072001500232082001400247245012700261250001800388264008500406300006400491336002600555337002600581338003600607347002400643505170400667520240302371650002804774650001604802650001604818650001404834650002404848650004004872650003604912650002704948650004004975650002905015700008905044700007705133710003405210773002605244776003605270776003605306776003605342856004605378912001405424912001505438950006105453950006605514978-3-031-27349-0DE-He21320230823150306.0cr nn 008mamaa230823s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312734909978-3-031-27349-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-27349-02doi 4aHF5548.7-5548.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.722314aThe Palgrave Handbook of Occupational Stressh[electronic resource] /cedited by Philippe Fauquet-Alekhine, James Erskine.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXXX, 510 p. 69 illus., 4 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aPart 1 - Stress description -- Chapter I - Introduction -- Chapter II - Conceptualization of Stress -- Chapter III - The Cycle of Stress -- Chapter IV - Animal models in neuroscience: A focus on stress -- Part II - Stress assessment,- Chapter V - Physiological assessment of the state of mental stress at work -- Chapter VI - Psychological assessment of the state of mental stress at work -- Chapter VII - Stress Assessment in Daily Life Using the Experience Sampling Method -- Chapter VIII - Psychosocial risks at work: fundamentals and stakes -- Chapter IX - Psychosocial risks at work: Outlines of the evaluation approach -- Chapter X - Assessment of Psychosocial Risks: methods -- Chapter XI - Assessment of Psychosocial Risks: questionnaire review -- Chapter XII - Visualizing results of a Psychosocial Risks assessment through questionnaires -- Part III - Using stress at work -- Chapter XIII - Leadership styles: work stress and related outcomes - health outcomes -- Chapter XIV- Leadership styles and related outcomes - practical suggestions -- Chapter XV - Occupational training, competencies and stress -- Chapter XVI - Stress adjustment as a criterion for hiring in high-risk jobs -- Part IV - Macro description of stress -- Chapter XVII - Cross-cultural ideas on stress -- Chapter XVIII - Stress in different professional sectors -- Chapter XIX - The impact of stress among undergraduate students: supporting resilience and wellbeing early in career progression -- Part V - Dealing with stress -- Chapter XX - Stress Prevention Measures in the Workplace -- Chapter XXII - Stress and resilience in the workplace -- Chapter XXIII - Pharmacology for stress -- Chapter XXIV – Conclusion. .  aThis handbook brings together an international group of experts to offer a comprehensive resource on occupational stress. Including both theoretical and practical perspectives, it examines ways to reduce and treat stress, as well as the physiological, psychosocial, and neural underpinnings of it. Through 24 original and carefully selected essays, the authors offer new insights, resources, and tools to better understand, manage and treat stress in a professional environment. The book’s chapters are divided into 5 parts that address the conceptualisation of stress; present theoretical models (including the contribution of animal models); examine the psychological and physiological aspects of stress and ways to assess it; delve into psychosocial risks at work and their assessment (means and methods); and investigate how to cope with stress at work, including resilience training. Aspects such as the effects of leadership, simulation training, and stress-tests for hiring are also presented and discussed. The volume ends by exploring broader considerations regarding stress and culture, stress and occupational sectors (with a chapter focusing on studentship), and the pharmacology of stress. This handbook is an essential reference for researchers in organisational psychology, as well as business and management and education, who are interested in stress. Healthcare workers and therapists who treat stress will also find an invaluable resource in this far-reaching yet accessible collection.

With an interdisciplinary scope that addresses psychological and technological issues, this unique book shows how cognitive science is furthered by technology(or platforms) while simultaneously illustrating how the study of cognitive processes is helping shape technological products. Accordingly, it offers a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in a broad array of fields, such as psychology, science, engineering and management. 0aCognition. 0aIntellect.14aCognition.24aIntelligence.1 aMukherjee, Sumitava.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aDutt, Varun.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aSrinivasan, Narayanan.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981993965708iPrinted edition:z978981993967108iPrinted edition:z978981993968840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-3966-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06166nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245016300248250001800411264007500429300006400504336002600568337002600594338003600620347002400656490009000680505203900770520217202809650001604981650001904997650002005016650004005036650001905076650001705095700007605112710003405188773002605222776003605248776003605284776003605320830009005356856004605446912001405492912001505506950006105521950006605582978-3-031-36312-2DE-He21320230829140915.0cr nn 008mamaa230829s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313631229978-3-031-36312-27 a10.1007/978-3-031-36312-22doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aSocial Work, Mental Health, and Public Policy in Diverse Contextsh[electronic resource] :bChinese and Cross-Cultural Perspectives /cedited by Sheying Chen.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIV, 230 p. 20 illus., 5 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aInternational Perspectives on Social Policy, Administration, and Practice,x2625-69830 aPart I.

Unlike social policy that started with the post-war idea of a welfare state in the mid-20th century, social work traces its roots to individual casework pioneered by the Charity Organization Society (COS), early social administration including state-wide poverty relief (an advocacy effort of the COS but with deep roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century), and social action emphasizing political activities to improve social conditions (originating from the Settlement House Movement which began in the 1880s). The development of social work is historically intertwined with that of public welfare, philanthropy, and charity and is an inherently international subject. This conception is broader than “international social work” as a discrete field of professional practice, which crosses geopolitical borders and all levels of social and economic organizations with a focus on development. However, each nation has a story of its own in terms of professionalization of social work in the evolution of public welfare and philanthropic/charitable undertaking within its particular economic, political, social, and cultural settings. A wide-ranging and in-depth study of various (especially non-Western) country cases is essential to an adequate, comprehensive understanding of the social work profession, which is also a basic requirement of its value of diversity. China is undoubtedly an important case with the largest population on earth. It’s also unique in view of so-called Chinese characteristics which are sometimes fundamentally different from other (particularly Western) societies. It’s even intriguing given the country’s lengthy, complex history and its recent, rapid rise to a global superpower with a claim of national goals and core values that seem to be rather considerable to social work as a helping profession. Therefore, any significant lessons learned from the Chinese experiences would help with a better international understanding and further advancement of social work and public welfare at a global scale. 0aPsychology. 0aSocial policy. 0aSocial service.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aSocial Policy.24aSocial Work.1 aChen, Sheying.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303136311508iPrinted edition:z978303136313908iPrinted edition:z9783031363146 0aInternational Perspectives on Social Policy, Administration, and Practice,x2625-698340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36312-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04108nam a22005415i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172072001600183072002300199072001500222082001500237245014200252250001800394264007500412300006300487336002600550337002600576338003600602347002400638505117300662520094001835650002502775650001602800650003002816650001702846650001602863650002602879650002702905650002702932700008202959700008103041700007403122710003403196773002603230776003603256776003603292776003603328856004603364912001403410912001503424950006103439950006603500978-3-031-37480-7DE-He21320230830083258.0cr nn 008mamaa230830s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313748079978-3-031-37480-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-37480-72doi 4aRA1148 7aJMK2bicssc 7aPSY0140002bisacsh 7aJMK2thema04a614.1522314aThe History and Future of Correctional Psychologyh[electronic resource] /cedited by Philip R.

Reflections on CBT Supervision and Training for Therapy and Consultation.  aThis book provides a scientific and practical guide for training and supervision in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It builds on more general fundamentals of clinical supervision with a theory-driven approach backed by empirical support for training and supervising clinicians in the practice of CBT. The book dispels the myth of “do it, teach it” as it relates to supervision and addresses the importance of recognizing that one size does not fit all with CBT supervision. The volume synthesizes CBT research on supervision and links it to the practice of supervision. It reviews components of supervision that warrant consideration (e.g., therapeutic alliance, ethics), specific settings (e.g., medical setting, schools) and clients (e.g., culture, individual, group, disability, and high-risk). In addition, it addresses a neglected area of developing competency, including developmental models as well as measuring trainee and supervisor competency in the provision of clinical supervision. The book recommends future directions on how to integrate technology into supervision to enhance the quality of supervision and, ultimately, client outcome. Key areas of coverage include: Major constructs in CBT supervision and training. Supervising work with various clients, including individuals, children, adolescents, families, and couples. Supervision and high-risk cases. Teaching and supervision within a behavioral medicine context. Issues of diversity, technology, and ethics of supervision. The Handbook of Training and Supervision in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is an is an essential resource for researchers, professors, and graduate students as well as clinicians, therapists, and other professionals in clinical and school psychology, pediatrics, social work, developmental psychology, behavioral therapy/rehabilitation, child and adolescent psychiatry, nursing, and special education. 0aSchool Psychology. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aPediatrics. 0aClinical psychology. 0aDevelopmental psychology.14aSchool Psychology.24aClinical Social Work.24aPediatrics.24aClinical Psychology.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.24aDevelopmental Psychology.1 aTerjesen, Mark D.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aDel Vecchio, Tamara.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303133734508iPrinted edition:z978303133736908iPrinted edition:z978303133737640uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-33735-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05426nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001200243100015000255245022200405250001800627264007500645300004300720336002600763337002600789338003600815347002400851505116500875520168102040650003003721650002303751650002503774650002303799650001903822650003003841650003803871650002303909650002503932650002603957650001903983700014604002700014804148700007604296700008204372710003404454773002604488776003604514776003604550776003604586856004604622912001404668912001504682950006104697950006604758978-3-031-33969-1DE-He21320230909152821.0cr nn 008mamaa230909s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313396919978-3-031-33969-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-33969-12doi 4aBF712-724.92 7aJMC2bicssc 7aPSY0390002bisacsh 7aJMC2thema04a1552231 aGabrielsen, Terisa P.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0002-4955-64191https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4955-64194aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aAssessment of Autism in Females and Nuanced Presentationsh[electronic resource] :bIntegrating Research into Practice /cby Terisa P.

It follows a lifespan framework, guiding readers through comprehensive assessment processes at any age. The book integrates interpretations of standardized measures, information from scientific literature, and context from first-person accounts to provide a more nuanced and sensitive approach to assessment. It addresses implications for improved treatment and supports based on comprehensive assessment processes and includes case studies within each age range to consolidate and illustrate assessment processes. Key areas of coverage include: Interdisciplinary assessment processes, including psychology, speech and language pathology, education, and health care disciplines. Lifespan approach to comprehensive assessment of autism in females/atypical autism. Guide to interpretation of standardized measures in females/atypical autism. Additional assessment tools and processes to provide diagnostic clarity. Descriptions of barriers in diagnostic processes from first-person accounts. Intervention and support strategies tied to assessment data. In-depth explanations of evidence and at-a-glance summaries. Assessment of Autism in Females and Nuanced Presentations is a must-have resource for researchers, professors, and graduate students as well as clinicians, practitioners, and policymakers in developmental and clinical psychology, speech language pathology, medicine, education, social work, mental health, and all interrelated disciplines. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSchool Psychology. 0aInclusive education. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aPublic health.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aChild and Adolescence Psychology.24aSchool Psychology.24aInclusive Education.24aClinical Social Work.24aPublic Health.1 aBegay, K.

It emphasizes user practice, attitudes, and experience, and their changing place within developing rehabilitation frameworks. It looks at how users have adopted, integrated, and innovated with games to facilitate rehabilitation. Topics include game technology, game design and accessibility, web-based technologies vs pervasive and mobile technologies, social and collaborative aspects, and rehabilitative outcome. Games for rehabilitation are gaining interest from different communities such as medicine, psychology, and rehabilitation. A distinction can be made between games specifically made for rehabilitative purposes and games made for the general public but that are used in rehabilitation as well. Games have allowed the building of new/complementary forms for rehabilitation and offered new options to produce rehabilitative activities and experiences. 0aMedical sciences. 0aNeuropsychology. 0aApplication software. 0aPhysical therapy. 0aOccupational therapy. 0aClinical health psychology.14aHealth Sciences.24aNeuropsychology.24aComputer and Information Systems Applications.24aPhysiotherapy.24aOccupational Therapy.24aHealth Psychology.1 aBrooks, Eva.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0001-7286-08761https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7286-08764edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aBrown, David J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978107163369408iPrinted edition:z9781071633700 0aVirtual Reality Technologies for Health and Clinical Applications,x2199-469240uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-3371-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03697nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001600190072002300206072001600229082001500245100015900260245018300419250001800602264006900620300006200689336002600751337002600777338003600803347002400839490004500863505107000908520062701978650002302605650002502628650002802653650001702681650002602698650004002724710003402764773002602798776003602824776003602860776003602896830004502932856004602977912001403023912001503037950006103052950006603113978-3-031-41030-7DE-He21320230912075843.0cr nn 008mamaa230912s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314103079978-3-031-41030-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-41030-72doi 4aHV6250-6250.4 7aJKV2bicssc 7aSOC0040002bisacsh 7aJKVV2thema04a362.882231 aYarbrough, Jillian Williamson.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0003-4042-94881https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4042-94884aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aAcknowledging, Supporting and Empowering Workplace Bullying Victimsh[electronic resource] :bA Proactive Approach for Human Resource Managers /cby Jillian Williamson Yarbrough.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXI, 80 p. 11 illus., 4 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-83710 a1.

Conclusion.  aThis book identifies potential support for workplace victimization through an examination of employee’s needs and needs-based motivation theories. Based on contemporary research in victimology and long-standing needs-based theories, it outlines how workplace bullying victims’ needs can be identified and how victims of workplace harassment can be empowered through the development and attainment of their unmet needs. The volume will be of interest to practitioners at the intersection of organizational and forensic psychology practitioners examining lacking needs as motivators for workplace bullying or harassment. 0aVictims of crimes. 0aForensic psychology. 0aPsychology, Industrial.14aVictimology.24aForensic  Psychology.24aWork and Organizational Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303141029108iPrinted edition:z978303141031408iPrinted edition:z9783031410321 0aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-837140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-41030-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06486nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001500188072001500203072002300218072001400241072001400255082001400269245019700283250001800480264007500498300004200573336002600615337002600641338003600667347002400703505137200727520283302099650001604932650003004948650001704978650002904995650001905024650002905043650002705072650004505099650001905144650002705163700007805190700008105268700008305349700008205432710003405514773002605548776003605574776003605610776003605646856004605682912001405728912001505742950006105757950006605818978-3-031-29148-7DE-He21320230913193305.0cr nn 008mamaa230913s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830312914879978-3-031-29148-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-29148-72doi 4aBF81-107.L4 7aJM2bicssc 7aHB2bicssc 7aPSY0150002bisacsh 7aJM2thema 7aNH2thema04a150.922310aIdeological and Political Bias in Psychologyh[electronic resource] :bNature, Scope, and Solutions /cedited by Craig L.

Guidelines for Decreasing Political Bias in Psychological Science and Practice.  aThis book examines the traditional assumptions made by academics and professionals alike that have embedded sociopolitical biases that impede practice. and undermine efforts to achieve an objective scientific status. If allowed to go unchallenged, the credibility of psychology as a discipline is compromised. This contributed volume thoroughly and comprehensively examines this concern in a conceptually and empirically rigorous manner and offers constructive solutions for minimizing undue political influences within the field of psychology. Societies in the 21st century desperately need reliable psychological science, but we don’t have it. This important volume explains one of the main reasons why we are making little progress on any issue that gets contaminated by the left-right culture war: because the field of psychology is an enthusiastic member of one of the two teams, so it rejects findings and researchers who question its ideological commitments. The authors of this engaging volume also show us the way out. They diagnose the social dynamics of bias and point to reforms that would give us the psychology that we need to address 21st century problems. Jonathan Haidt, Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership, NYU—Stern School of Business and author of The Righteous Mind The boundaries of free speech, censorship, moral cultures, social justice, and ideological biases are among the many incendiary topics discussed in this book. If you are looking for a deep-dive into real-world contemporary controversies, Ideological and Political Bias in Psychology fits the bill. The chapters are thoughtful and thought-provoking. Most readers will find something to agree with and something to rage at in almost every chapter. It just may change how you think about some of these topics. Diane F. Halpern, Professor of Psychology Emerita, Claremont McKenna College and Past President, American Psychological Association Unless the political left is always correct about everything (in which case, we wouldn’t need to do research; we could just ask a leftist), the growing political monoculture of social science is a major barrier to our search for the truth. This volume shows how ideological bias should be treated as a source of research error, up there with classic methodological flaws like non-random assignment and non-blind measurement. Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and the author of Rationality An important read for academics curious about how their politics fashions beliefs that too often are uncritically taken for granted, and for non-academics wondering why we can't shake off the politics that so influences scientific work.

Everybody has his/her own lifestyle but may not necessarily be aware of what constitutes a healthy lifestyle. Knowledge gained from the Internet may be scattered and inaccurate and, if adhered to, may lead to loss of life. The COVID-19 pandemic increased people's awareness of the need for a healthy lifestyle but how to adopt a healthy lifestyle is something to be clarified since every individual is different (body type, situation, etc.), and hence, their needs will be different as well. This book addresses such questions and explores how the use of technology in the areas mentioned above can enable each individual to easily achieve a healthy lifestyle. 0aPsychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.1 aKumar, Sunil.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aGupta, Sunil.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut1 aNagpal, Pooja.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981993038808iPrinted edition:z978981993040108iPrinted edition:z978981993041840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-3039-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)02617nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001400243100008200257245013300339250001800472264006900490300003300559336002600592337002600618338003600644347002400680490004500704505029600749520056601045650002801611650002301639650002701662650003101689650002401720710003401744773002601778776003601804776003601840830004501876856004601921912001401967912001501981950006101996950006602057978-3-031-42844-9DE-He21320230921000118.0cr nn 008mamaa230921s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314284499978-3-031-42844-97 a10.1007/978-3-031-42844-92doi 4aHF5548.7-.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.72231 aAddimando, Federico.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aClient-Centered Business Consultingh[electronic resource] :bThe Power of Psychological Understanding /cby Federico Addimando.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aIX, 100 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-83710 aChapter 1.

It is designed to be student and practitioner oriented by drawing on real world examples of therapeutic encounters in mental health settings to illustrate how theory can inform practice. Good communication is the cornerstone of good clinical practice and is foundational for building therapeutic alliance. Although therapists and counsellors are often highly skilled in their therapeutic modalities, this book offers additional practical suggestions about how families engage in social actions and positioning themselves and others in their talk. The book also takes wider micro and macro ecological systems within which systemic psychotherapists and counsellors work into account and consider the ways that these larger social influences are experienced within institutional discourses. This unique book will be a valuable resource across a broad spectrum of professions and researchers, including counsellors, psychotherapists, family therapists, psychiatrists, nurses, play therapists, speech and language therapists, and mental health social workers.

Conclusion.  a“A deeply engaged inquiry into the possibility of mystical spiritual direction today - the true topic of the book is ourselves, our spiritual fate. Furthermore, Murphy ruthlessly analyses how mystical experience is caught in the global capitalist commodification - if you really want an authentic spiritual experience, you should begin with a critique of capitalism.” —Professor Slavoj Zizek, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, UK “Through a powerfully illuminating reading of Jacques Lacan’s ‘anti-experientialist’ psychoanalytic practice, Murphy uncovers the cultural forces which reduce spirituality to superficial notions of wellbeing.” —Dr Edward Howells, Associate Tutor at Ripon College Cuddesdon and Associate Member of Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford, UK This book examines Lacanian psychoanalysis and Christian mystical theology demonstrating the former’s potential for reinvigorating spiritual direction. The author outlines how current methods of spiritual direction become saturated with self-help psycho-pop methodologies, and that desire has therefore been foreclosed in these practices. He suggests that the root of this is a focus on ‘positive affective experientialism’, which means spiritual direction must focus on emotional wholeness, healing and positivity. Finally, he argues that a new dialogue between John of the Cross (a mystic whose writings on spiritual direction formulate part of the core of the Catholic spiritual tradition) and Jacques Lacan can open the way for a spiritual direction beyond the confines of experientialism. The book concludes that we can only escape the experiential commodification of spiritual direction by critiquing the drive to experience in and of itself. This novel work will appeal in particular to students and scholars of psychoanalysis, religion, philosophy and critical theory.

Epilogue.  aAs people around the globe experience more civil unrest and environmental disruption, the difficulties social workers face in their practice are becoming increasingly complex. This textbook deepens and expands the resilience-enhancing stress model (RESM) skill set and techniques so that social workers can more effectively serve clients and constituencies who are trying to overcome the stress of difficult life transitions and challenging environmental demands. It is designed as a companion piece to A Resilience-Enhancing Stress Model: A Social Work Multisystemic Practice Approach (Springer, 2022). The intent of the RESM is to further expand social workers' practice skill sets with additional concepts from the anti-oppressive practice (AOP) and coaching literature that aligns with the Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards from the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). The book's 12 chapters are organized around life transitions and illustrate skills, techniques, and interviews important to the enhancement of resilience. Among the topics covered: The Resilience-Enhancing Stress Model: Articulating Anti-Oppressive Practice Exploring the Role of Cultural Diversity in Resilient Social Functioning: Theory and Skills Countering Human Rights Violations During Life Transitions Facilitating Community Development Following Disruption Resilience Enhancement in Social Work Practice: Anti-Oppressive Social Work Skills and Techniques uniquely offers practitioners a knowledge base to exponentiate their efficacy in identifying and fortifying resilience in a time in history when it appears to be imperative. It is written for a student social work audience at the generalist or advanced generalist level for practice across a range of populations and settings. It contains traditional and contemporary human behavior content that supports a social work narrative methodology and a life course perspective. It could be taught with its predecessor across one or two semesters. Practitioners in the field who are new to this content could also find the text a valuable resource. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aSocial service. 0aPsychology. 0aLife cycle, Human. 0aSocial work education.14aClinical Social Work.24aTheory and Method in Social Work.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aLife Course.24aSocial Work Education.1 aGreene, Roberta.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aGreene, Nancy.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aCorley, Connie.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303138517908iPrinted edition:z978303138519308iPrinted edition:z978303138520940uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-38518-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05242nam a22005055i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245011300248250001800361264006900379300006600448336002600514337002600540338003600566347002400602490004500626505115400671520228401825650001604109650002604125650004004151650002204191650002604213700008204239710003404321773002604355776003604381776003604417776003604453830004504489856004604534912001404580912001504594950006104609950006604670978-3-031-41965-2DE-He21320230930002622.0cr nn 008mamaa230930s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314196529978-3-031-41965-27 a10.1007/978-3-031-41965-22doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022310aPeace as Liberationh[electronic resource] :bVisions and Praxis from Below /cedited by Fatima Waqi Sajjad.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXVII, 226 p. 13 illus., 10 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aPeace Psychology Book Series,x2197-57870 aIntroduction: Let me be fully Human -- Part One: Reimagining Peace from below -- Restoring Peace as if our Life Depends on it (as it does!) -- Iqbalian Liberation Theology: Spiritual Self-Affirmation, Meritocratic Democracy and Non-Hegemonic International Orders -- Part Two: Transformational Resistance to undo Oppression -- The Liberatory Effects of Indigenous Ceremonies in the Aftermath of Mass Trauma -- What do we resist when we resist?

This book celebrates the voices and the agency of the subalterns, honoring their visions, testimonies and struggles to push boundaries and create spaces for peace within oppressive environments. “Visions and Praxis from below” refers to peace visions and struggles of the people who live “below the vital ability of shaping the world according to their own vision”. It is a challenge to the hegemonic perspective that ‘credible’ thinking on peace can only be done by the people ‘from above’. This perspective will add to the understanding of not only peace psychologists, but all those who work toward social justice. “Peace as Liberation: Visions and Praxis from Below is a welcome intervention in the field of peace psychology, and just what is needed to redress the entrenched Eurocentricity of peace studies. Incisive, confronting and genuine, it is a wonderful collection of essays that centres the voices and agency of subaltern scholars. Highly recommended." --Richard Jackson, University of Otago, New Zealand “After fighting the 20 Years War by demonizing Islam and being defeated, US NATO started a new proxy war by demonizing the former Cold War enemy. Global South is no longer as docile as before. No, its very wisdom sheds light on the path to save innocent people who sacrifice blood in the proxy war.” -- Isezaki Kenji, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Japan “We are living through a profoundly significant moment in the history of Decolonisation, even as old Balances are splintering , and old Hegemons are tottering. It is timely, it is relevant, and it adds depth to the burgeoning clamor of critiques, as the 'subalterns' are finding their Voice. freed from the muzzles of their erstwhile masters.” -- Rajani Kanth , ex-Harvard University, United States “This groundbreaking book breaks barriers in peace studies, giving voice to marginalized perspectives and challenging epistemic violence. A transformative must-read.” -- Zahid Shahab Ahmed, Deakin University, Australia. 0aPsychology. 0aPolitical psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aPeace Psychology.24aPolitical Psychology.1 aSajjad, Fatima Waqi.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303141964508iPrinted edition:z978303141966908iPrinted edition:z9783031419676 0aPeace Psychology Book Series,x2197-578740uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-41965-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03766nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007900248245009700327250001800424264007500442300006500517336002600582337002600608338003600634347002400670505032600694520152801020650001602548650002902564650002502593650002502618650002002643650001402663650004002677650002502717650001902742650002502761650002102786650002302807710003402830773002602864776003602890776003602926776003602962856004602998912001403044912001503058950006103073950006603134978-3-031-38750-0DE-He21320231005134057.0cr nn 008mamaa231005s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313875009978-3-031-38750-07 a10.1007/978-3-031-38750-02doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aLake, C.

What is different is the proposal that psychotherapists manage the overall care of Bipolar clients. The increased number of publications about Bipolar over the past decades has enhanced the recognition of Bipolar. As many as 16 million individuals in the US may have a Bipolar episode at some point. Psychiatrists have traditionally managed Bipolar clients but there are not enough psychiatrists and they generally spend only 10 to 15 minutes every one to six months with their clients—often not enough time to recognize oncoming Bipolar episodes. Therapeutic strategy has changed from treating acute episodes to postponing next episodes. Psychotherapists see their clients for 50 minutes every week and are in a better position to recognize developing episodes. Psychotherapists do not prescribe and medicines are usually needed along with psychotherapy for best results. This book encourages psychotherapists to vet and collaborate with prescribers in caring for the therapists’ Bipolar clients. Lacking in the psychotherapists’ armamentarium for treating Bipolar clients is education regarding diagnostic signs, symptoms, and treatment including the most productive medications.

Its chapters deftly summarize the recent knowledge base about families with adolescents and explains how to apply these results across mental health and social services disciplines. The new edition clearly illustrates family concerns and theoretical perspectives through real-world vignettes and cogent use of family assessment measures. Chapters offer a broad understanding of how diversity in all its forms – including race/ethnicity, culture, religion, and sexual orientation – has created a much more nuanced understanding of how families with adolescents are able to function within their environment. Both major challenges to families and communities form the backdrop of the second edition’s focus on forecasting in which the theoretical, empirical, and intervention literatures necessarily move in service to the health and well-being of families with adolescents. Featured topics include: Central concepts of family development, family systems, ecological, attachment, and social learning theories in relation to families with adolescents. Influence of the family on adolescent problem behavior, mental health concerns, substance use issues, educational attainment, and social competence outcomes. Selected studies on parenting behaviors, conflict resolution, and other major aspects of families with adolescents. Application topics in family-based intervention and prevention programs. Integrating theory, research, and applications to create a “triple threat” model. Diversity issues surrounding race/ethnicity, culture, religion, and sexual orientation. Families with Adolescents, Second Edition, is an essential resource for researchers, professors, and graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as professionals and other mental health clinicians, practitioners, and therapists in clinical child and developmental psychology, family studies, human development, sociology, social work, education, and all allied disciplines. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aSociology. 0aSocial groups. 0aSocial psychiatry. 0aSchool Psychology. 0aPublic health. 0aEducational sociology.14aDevelopmental Psychology.24aSociology of Family, Youth and Aging.24aClinical Social Work.24aSchool Psychology.24aPublic Health.24aSociology of Education.1 aLim, Ji-Young.eauthor.0(orcid)0000-0001-5090-26091https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5090-26094aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303143406808iPrinted edition:z978303143408208iPrinted edition:z9783031434099 0aAdvancing Responsible Adolescent Development,x2195-090340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43407-5  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06477nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236245014300248250001800391264007500409300006500484336002600549337002600575338003600601347002400637505197300661520260402634650001605238650002505254650001705279650002905296650004005325650002505365650004505390700007605435700007805511710003405589773002605623776003605649776003605685776003605721856004605757912001405803912001505817950006105832950006605893978-3-031-41788-7DE-He21320231009141131.0cr nn 008mamaa231009s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314178879978-3-031-41788-77 a10.1007/978-3-031-41788-72doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a15022312aA Dimensional Approach to Schizotypyh[electronic resource] :bConceptualization and Treatment /cedited by Simone Cheli, Paul H.

Describing schizotypy as a phenomenon that can be located on a continuum ranging from sub-clinical states to severe disorders, the editors have brought together experts in this field to discuss approaches to assessment, conceptualization, and treatment. This volume aims to provide a unique and clinically oriented perspective on schizotypy as a feature of personality and psychopathology. An essential resource for professionals, researchers, and academics the reader will gain knowledge of: Underlying maladaptive traits that can emerge as schizotypy Dimensional and transdiagnostic approaches to psychopathology Relationship to metacognition, mentalizing, attachment, self-criticism and interpersonal criticism This remarkable book brings together many influential scholars under the general rubric of dimensional approaches to schizotypy and can thereby serve as a real boon to both scientists and practitioners. Coverage of the current literature is extensive, and goes well beyond schizotypy research per se. Indeed, focal research on schizotypy as a psychopathological phenomenon is covered thoroughly yet is only one aspect of a much more comprehensive volume. Robert F. Krueger - University of Minnesota, USA In this thoughtful edited volume, Cheli and Lysaker build on these foundations by bringing together leaders in the field of schizotypy, personality and schizophrenia with the goal of translating complex research findings into practical, useful and clinically relevant information. They succeed in this goal with masterful integration of the research and clinical literature highlighting transdiagnostic processes central to the human experience such as metacognition, mentalizing, attachment, self- and interpersonal criticism that can be targeted in treatment. Carla Sharp - University of Houston, USA “A Dimensional Approach to Schizotypy” includes contributions from a number of researchers at the forefront of psychopathology and psychiatric nosology. The editors provide us with a 30,000-foot view of current-day schizotypy, accompanied by fascinating clinical theory and an updated discussion of transdiagnostic clinical implications. These chapters also include important new information on unique cultural perspectives, encouraging better representation of global populations, critical for the generalizability and public health impact of our research.

However, there are times when we observe people and try to comprehend their intentions. We rely on "body language". This reliance propagates the misleading idea that people communicate with their bodies just as they do with words. This is where misunderstandings frequently occur, sometimes even due to incorrect concepts propagated by so-called experts. The result is a loss of trust among readers or, worse, the disruption of interactions and relationships. Through a science-based approach, this work is primarily dedicated to all readers aged 18 and above who are passionate about communication and keen to understand others. Additionally, professionals from various sectors will find practical concepts and references for research, study, and daily work. 0aPsychology. 0aPsychobiology. 0aNeuropsychology. 0aCognitive psychology. 0aSocial psychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aBiological Psychology.24aNeuropsychology.24aCognitive Psychology.24aSocial Psychology.1 aAdriani, Walter.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303143570608iPrinted edition:z978303143572008iPrinted edition:z978303143573740uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43571-3  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)02763nam a22004575i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100008700248245014000335250001800475264007500493300006200568336002600630337002600656338003600682347002400718490004500742520104700787650001601834650004001850710003401890773002601924776003601950776003601986776003602022830004502058856004602103912001402149912001502163950006102178950006602239978-3-031-41929-4DE-He21320231010133619.0cr nn 008mamaa231010s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314192949978-3-031-41929-47 a10.1007/978-3-031-41929-42doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aRawatlal, Kamilla Varsha.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aClinical Supervision in South Africah[electronic resource] :bImproving practice with limited resources /cby Kamilla Varsha Rawatlal.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXV, 106 p. 7 illus., 6 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringerBriefs in Psychology,x2192-8371  aIn this publication, an ecological, relational framework to support practitioners i. e.

With an increased uptake of mental health care services in recent times and the advent of teletherapy to make these services more accessible, health care professionals have had to also reconcile working within institutional structures that place challenges and pressures. Psychologists and Health Professionals employed in various governmental institutions such as health and higher education have also been subject to multiple competing demands that increase the risk of compassion fatigue and burnout.

It provides strategies on how to best develop and adapt clinical assessment procedures and therapeutic interventions to better meet the unique needs found in these settings. Chapters synthesize existing literature to introduce the reader to profession-specific factors issues that exist in these contexts and describe the challenges that can present when working with police, firefighters, EMS, emergency communications operators, crime scene investigators, and corrections personnel. The book covers a range of topics that clinicians and trainees need to understand the relevant issues, develop effective treatment plans, and deliver appropriate psychological services in public safety settings. First Responder Mental Health: A Clinician’s Guide will be essential reading for mental health professionals working with first responders, as well as those in training. . 0aClinical psychology. 0aForensic psychology.14aClinical Psychology.24aForensic  Psychology.1 aBourke, Michael L.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aVan Hasselt, Vincent B.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aBuser, Sam J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303138148508iPrinted edition:z978303138150808iPrinted edition:z978303138151540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-38149-2  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03026nam a22004455i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172072001600183072002300199072001500222082001500237100007500252245013000327250001800457264006900475300004300544336002600587337002600613338003600639347002400675505071900699520074101418650002502159650002602184710003402210773002602244776003602270776003602306776003602342856004602378912001402424912001502438950006102453950006602514978-3-031-44931-4DE-He21320231012081159.0cr nn 008mamaa231012s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314493149978-3-031-44931-47 a10.1007/978-3-031-44931-42doi 4aRA1148 7aJMK2bicssc 7aPSY0140002bisacsh 7aJMK2thema04a614.152231 aRassin, Eric.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aCase Studies in Legal Psychologyh[electronic resource] :bPsychological Perspectives on Criminal Evidence /cby Eric Rassin.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXI, 158 p. 13 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 aChapter 1.

With 11 real cases, this book illustrates how professional judges evaluate criminal evidence. Moreover, the legal psychological approach to the same evidence is discussed, as the author served as a psychological expert witness in these cases. Targeted pieces of evidence and related topics include: • Eyewitness identification • Eyewitness testimony • Confession evidence • Deception • Memory flaws • Legal decision making It is a must-read for practitioners and graduate students in criminal law, forensic psychology, and legal psychology. 0aForensic psychology.14aForensic  Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303144930708iPrinted edition:z978303144932108iPrinted edition:z978303144933840uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-44931-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03003nam a22004815i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001600189072002300205072001500228082001400243100007400257245015700331250001800488264006900506300006500575336002600640337002600666338003600692347002400728505021500752520103300967650002802000650001602028650002702044650004002071650004002111710003402151773002602185776003602211776003602247776003602283856004602319912001402365912001502379950006102394950006602455978-3-031-40332-3DE-He21320231013142755.0cr nn 008mamaa231013s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314033239978-3-031-40332-37 a10.1007/978-3-031-40332-32doi 4aHF5548.7-.85 7aJMJ2bicssc 7aPSY0210002bisacsh 7aJMJ2thema04a158.72231 aLaske, Otto.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aAdvanced Systems-Level Problem Solving, Volume 1h[electronic resource] :bApproaching Real-World Complexity with Dialectical Thinking /cby Otto Laske.  a2nd ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXXIX, 193 p. 25 illus., 8 illus. in color.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1 What is your Inquiring System? -- 2 Modifications of truth over the lifespan -- 3 The concept of dialectic -- 4 How well-tempered is your thought clavier? -- 5 A process-model of social-emotional development.  aThis three-volume set introduces the practice of advanced, ‘dialectical’ systems-level problem solving in both the social and natural sciences.

Originally published in Portuguese, this contributed volume is now translated into English and presents for the first time to international researchers and students a comprehensive overview of a research program developed for more than three decades in Brazil which gave birth to a unique teaching program based on the concept of stimulus equivalence: the Learning to Read and Write in Small Steps. The book is divided into four parts. The first part presents the theoretical framework and the historical context in which the teaching program was developed by the group led by Drs. Julio Cesar de Rose and Deisy das Graças de Souza, currently organized in the National Institute of Science and Technology on Behavior, Cognition, and Learning (INCT/ECCE). The second part describes the modules that make up the Learning to Read and Write in Small Steps teaching program. The third part presents results of empirical research conducted with children with intellectual and hearing disabilities and illiterate adults. Finally, the fourth part presents contributions from other areas of knowledge – such as speech therapy, linguistics, and education – to the understanding of reading and writing and possible dialogues between them and behavior analysis. Contributions of Behavior Analysis to Reading and Writing Comprehension will be of interest to researchers and students in the fields of psychology and education interested in the application of behavior analysis to teaching and learning processes.

A Cognitive-Developmental Theory of Work Capability -- 2 A Cognitive Theory of Organizations -- 3 The Anatomy of the Internal Workplace -- 4 Dialectical Thinking and Listening in the Workplace -- 5 Developmental Issues of Team Collaboration.  aThis three-volume set introduces the practice of advanced, ‘dialectical’ systems-level problem solving in both the social and natural sciences. In social science, it opens new vistas regarding organizational, strategy, and work design. In the natural sciences, it provides heretofore missing conceptions of physical systems in peril due to the climate crisis. In addition, the author draws conclusions that are important for advancing generative AI. The monograph presents novel conceptual tools that directly impact the internal structure of a systems analyst’s mental processing in real time. While the first volume lays the theoretical groundwork for dialectical systems analysis, the second, focusing on the nature of work, lays bare the structure of complex thinking in terms of the ‘thought forms’ it requires. In order to facilitate better understanding of the principles taught in the first two volumes, the third volume provides a Manual of Dialectical Thought Forms, which is the only one in existence today. 0aPsychology, Industrial. 0aPsychology.14aWork and Organizational Psychology.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aOrganizational Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303140984408iPrinted edition:z978303140986808iPrinted edition:z978303140987540uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-40985-1  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03891nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172072001600183072002300199072001500222082001500237245018700252250001800439264007500457300006600532336002600598337002600624338003600650347002400686490004600710505059400756520117701350650002502527650001702552650001902569650002602588650002602614650002302640650001902663650004202682700007502724700007602799700008202875710003402957773002602991776003603017776003603053830004603089856004603135912001403181912001503195950006103210950006603271978-3-031-41702-3DE-He21320231013053931.0cr nn 008mamaa231013s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314170239978-3-031-41702-37 a10.1007/978-3-031-41702-32doi 4aRA1148 7aJMK2bicssc 7aPSY0140002bisacsh 7aJMK2thema04a614.1522310aEmotional and Behavioural Problems of Young Offenders in Singaporeh[electronic resource] :bFindings from the EPYC Study /cedited by Dongdong Li, Chi Meng Chu, David P.

Conclusions and Recommendations.  aThis book presents the findings from the Enhancing Positive Outcomes in Youth and the Community (EPYC) study. EPYC is a ground-breaking nationwide 10-year longitudinal study on young offenders in Singapore. It focuses on understanding crime prevention, rehabilitation, and reintegration of these youths. Data were collected through yearly interviews, external assessments, and linkage of administrative records to provide a comprehensive picture of participants. In addition, a non-offender youth sample was included as a normative comparison sample. The research and findings of this book focus on: Prevalence rates and comorbidity of Emotional and Behavioural Problems (EBPs) in young offenders Drug use and Re-offending Risk and Protective Factors for EBPs As this study represents one of the first in Asia and one of few across the globe with such in-depth investigations, it aims to advance the understanding of youth offending and associated emotional and behavioural issues. This book is best suited for criminal justice and mental health scholars, practitioners, and policy makers who are working with Asian populations or interested in cross-cultural comparisons. 0aForensic psychology. 0aCriminology. 0aMental health. 0aJuvenile delinquents.14aForensic  Psychology.24aAsian Criminology.24aMental Health.24aYouth Offending and Juvenile Justice.1 aLi, Dongdong.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aChu, Chi Meng.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aFarrington, David P.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303141701608iPrinted edition:z9783031417030 0aSpringerBriefs in Criminology,x2192-854140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-41702-3  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)06964nam a22006015i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001500188072001500203072002300218072001400241072001400255082001400269245018100283250001800464264007500482300004300557336002600600337002600626338003600652347002400688490007700712505249500789520214203284650001605426650003005442650002305472650003005495650002805525650002705553650002305580650003005603650002805633700009505661700008005756700007905836710003405915773002605949776003605975776003606011776003606047830007706083856004606160912001406206912001506220950006106235950006606296978-3-031-38882-8DE-He21320231016090223.0cr nn 008mamaa231016s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313888289978-3-031-38882-87 a10.1007/978-3-031-38882-82doi 4aBF81-107.L4 7aJM2bicssc 7aHB2bicssc 7aPSY0150002bisacsh 7aJM2thema 7aNH2thema04a150.922314aThe Transnational Legacy of Jean Piageth[electronic resource] :bA View from the 21st Century /cedited by Regina Helena de Freitas Campos, Érika Lourenço, Marc J.

The volume brings together contributions presented at the International Colloquium Jean Piaget in Brazil and Latin America, held during the 38th Annual Helena Antipoff Meeting, organized by the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in collaboration with the University of Geneva, Switzerland. The book is organized in three parts. Chapters in the first part analyze Piaget’s role as a builder of an international network in psychology, education and peace promotion in the 20th century, with a special focus on the circulation of his ideas and works between Switzerland and France. The second part focuses on historical and contemporary dialogues, conflicts and controversies between Piaget and other authors, such as Henri Wallon, Carl Rogers, Jürgen Habermas, and, especially, Helena Antipoff, the Russian-Brazilian psychologist and educator who was one of the first researchers to introduce Piaget in Brazil and to establish a bridge between Latin America and the Geneva school of psychological and educational sciences. Finally, chapters in the third part of the book explore different aspects of the reception and appropriation of Piaget’s works and ideas in the Brazilian context. The Transnational Legacy of Jean Piaget: A View from the 21st Century will be of interest to researchers in different fields within the human and social sciences, such as developmental, educational and school psychologists; educators; philosophers and historians of psychology and education interested in understanding how Piaget’s progressist ideas have contributed to the development of psychological and educational sciences in Europe and Latin America. Some chapters of this book were originally written in Portuguese and French and translated into English with the help of artificial intelligence. A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content. . 0aPsychology. 0aSocial sciencesxHistory. 0aSchool Psychology. 0aDevelopmental psychology. 0aEducational psychology.14aHistory of Psychology.24aSchool Psychology.24aDevelopmental Psychology.24aEducational Psychology.1 aCampos, Regina Helena de Freitas.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aLourenço, Érika.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aRatcliff, Marc J.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303138881108iPrinted edition:z978303138883508iPrinted edition:z9783031388842 0aLatin American Voices, Integrative Psychology and Humanities,x2524-581340uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-38882-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)03991nam a22005655i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172072001600183072002300199072001500222082001500237100007400252245014700326250001800473264007500491300003400566336002600600337002600626338003600652347002400688490008500712505060200797520137301399650002502772650001702797650001602814650001602830650002302846650001702869650002602886650002702912650002702939650002302966650001702989710003403006773002603040776003603066776003603102830008503138856004603223912001403269912001503283950006103298950006603359978-3-031-45886-6DE-He21320231017100919.0cr nn 008mamaa231016s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314588669978-3-031-45886-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-45886-62doi 4aRA1148 7aJMK2bicssc 7aPSY0140002bisacsh 7aJMK2thema04a614.152231 aSapp, Karla.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aUnderstanding Offending Populations and the Power of Correctional Psychotherapyh[electronic resource] :bUnlocking Insights /cby Karla Sapp.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Springer,c2023.  aXIII, 93 p.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda1 aSpringerBriefs in Offending Populations & Correctional Psychotherapy,x2731-89740 aChapter 1.

The offender population has long been considered the most difficult to engage in psychotherapy, often described as resistant, non-compliant, unworkable, and without feeling. This unique and culturally diverse population tend to find themselves, as a result, going through a cycle of arrest, conviction, incarceration, and release. Although other offender populations, such as female offenders, severe mentally ill, and sex offenders, have received considerable attention in scholarship, there has been little research focused on the treatment of the general offender population and how to reduce recidivism through the appropriate delivery of effective assessment and treatment services. This book will bridge that gap in literature, addressing: ● Who the offender population is ● Social and systematic factors they face ● Psychological understandings of criminal behavior ● Rehabilitation and psychotherapy theories and approaches to treatment , as well as best practices ● Future efforts in justice initiatives, advocacy, and public policy This book is best suited for upper-level undergraduates, graduate students and researchers, and practitioners in criminal justice fields and mental health professions working with offender populations. . 0aForensic psychology. 0aCorrections. 0aPunishment. 0aCounseling. 0aCriminal behavior. 0aCriminology.14aForensic  Psychology.24aPrison and Punishment.24aCounseling Psychology.24aCriminal Behavior.24aCriminology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303145885908iPrinted edition:z9783031458873 0aSpringerBriefs in Offending Populations & Correctional Psychotherapy,x2731-897440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-45886-6  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)02937nam a22004335i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001500184072002300199072001400222082001200236100007800248245010500326250001800431264006900449300003500518336002600553337002600579338003600605347002400641520141200665650001602077650004002093710003402133773002602167776003602193776003602229776003602265856004602301912001402347912001502361950006102376950006602437978-3-031-44308-4DE-He21320231019191914.0cr nn 008mamaa231019s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830314430849978-3-031-44308-47 a10.1007/978-3-031-44308-42doi 4aBF1-990 7aJM2bicssc 7aPSY0000002bisacsh 7aJM2thema04a1502231 aMotta, Robert W.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aSecondary Traumah[electronic resource] :bSilent Suffering and Its Treatment /cby Robert W.

While PTSD has garnered considerable attention in the literature, secondary trauma afflicts a far greater number of people. Secondary trauma refers to the spread of negative emotional and cognitive states from those who are traumatized to those who have close contact with these individuals. While PTSD and other forms of primary trauma can negatively alter one’s self-perception and result in a fearful distrust of one’s environment, secondary trauma taxes and drains one emotionally but often does not cause a weary distrust of the environment and negative self-view. The book delineates how, when, and where secondary trauma occurs and provides the latest information on treatments. it is noted that unlike primary trauma and PTSD which respond to traditional treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure therapy, secondary traumatization is best addressed with interventions such as targeted social support, various exercise interventions, mindfulness, yoga, animal assisted therapy, and immersion in natural environments. Secondary trauma is a common and commonly ignored stressor whose impact is wide ranging. This volume accessibly brings this problem to the fore and is a resource for all of those who deal with "silent sufferers" and paves the way for further, necessary study. 0aPsychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303144307708iPrinted edition:z978303144309108iPrinted edition:z978303144310740uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-44308-4  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05765nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001600190072002300206072001500229082001500244245020400259250001800463264007200481300006400553336002600617337002600643338003600669347002400705490003500729505264500764520082303409650002804232650002504260650003104285650002704316650001504343650002804358650002504386650004504411650001504456700014404471700008404615700008304699710003404782773002604816776003604842776003604878776003604914830003504950856004604985912001405031912001505045950006105060950006605121978-981-99-5571-8DE-He21320231024070411.0cr nn 008mamaa231024s2023    si |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97898199557189978-981-99-5571-87 a10.1007/978-981-99-5571-82doi 4aLB1050.9-1091 7aJNC2bicssc 7aEDU0090002bisacsh 7aJNC2thema04a370.1522310aPositive Psychology and Positive Education in Asiah[electronic resource] :bUnderstanding and Fostering Well-Being in Schools /cedited by Ronnel B.

Stimulated, in part, by the launch of positive psychology, wellbeing education has grown worldwide. Various theories of wellbeing have been adopted in education, coining the term 'wellbeing education', defined in this book as how school leaders and teachers plan to implement evidence-informed wellbeing interventions to promote wellbeing and academic goals. This book investigates a series of questions related to wellbeing education, and how evidence-informed wellbeing approaches are integrated into learning, teaching, and education. 0aEducational psychology. 0aEducational sociology. 0aTeachersxTraining of. 0aSchool management and organization. 0aSchool administration.14aEducational Psychology.24aSociology of Education.24aTeaching and Teacher Education.24aOrganization and Leadership.1 aWhite, Mathew A.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-3037-93521https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3037-93524edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aMcCallum, Faye.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0002-1961-38811https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1961-38814edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aBoyle, Christopher.eeditor.0(orcid)0000-0001-6196-76191https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6196-76194edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981995608108iPrinted edition:z978981995610408iPrinted edition:z978981995611140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-5609-8  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)04486nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001800190072002300208072001700231082001400248100007700262245009800339250001800437264007900455300004400534336002600578337002600604338003600630347002400666505042100690520227501111650002603386650002903412650002803441650002603469650003103495650001803526650003103544650002303575710003403598773002603632776003603658776003603694776003603730856004603766912001403812912001503826950006103841950006603902978-3-031-37734-1DE-He21320231025034608.0cr nn 008mamaa231025s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313773419978-3-031-37734-17 a10.1007/978-3-031-37734-12doi 4aHF5549-5549.5 7aKJMV22bicssc 7aBUS0300002bisacsh 7aKJMV22thema04a658.32231 aAdamsen, Billy.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aWork Identityh[electronic resource] :bA Neurophilosophical Perspective /cby Billy Adamsen.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer Nature Switzerland :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXXV, 167 p. 15 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1.

Conclusion.  a“This book presents a unique interdisciplinary blend of psychology, neurology, philosophy, sociology, real-life case studies, and a critical review of the methods and instruments used to assess work identity. Professor Adamsen’s broader take on work identity are invaluable additions to the talent management and human resources literature, and much like the author’s previous books, this one will indeed be lauded as a seminal, landmark work in the years to come.” - Daphne Halkias, Professor and Distinguished Research Fellow,Ecole des Ponts ParisTech Business School, France At present, 80% of the employees are no longer engaged in their work and capable of performing, while 44% are experiencing work related stress and getting sick from working. A significant increase in time spent on interpretation at work trying to understand what managers and colleagues are saying has been observed too. This book offers a critical view on vocational inventory tests and the development of the work language and the use of it describing work identity. As well as a neurophilosophical perspective on self and work identity, this book provides a plausible neurophilosophical explanation for the negative impact of losing work identity on our work behavior, well-being, and success. Furthermore, the author introduces the innovative Work Identity Pro, the first work identity test to independently measure work identity. It will be of great interest to scholars and students of human resources management, organisation studies and organisational psychology. It will also be of interest to managers and those with an interest in work identity, behaviour and well-being.

National statistics identify that 1:7 children in the United States are subjected to child abuse or neglect. The age group with the highest reported incidences are in the 1-3 year old age group. The primary perpetrators of this abuse are the child’s caregivers. This age is closely associated with the critical period of development in the areas of the brain, the child’s physiology and their social/emotional well being. When primary attachment is disrupted, delays and disruptions across many domains occur. When the perpetrator of their trauma is the same person who should be ensuring their safety, a child develops behaviors in an attempt to make sense of their world. The behaviors serve a purpose. Behavioral approaches which rely on positive and negative consequences do not adequately address the cause of the behavior and are therefore ineffective. Other existing trauma interventions rely on the individual to cognitively process information. However, when dysregulated, retrieval of information from the frontal lobe of the brain is not physiologically possible. All these approaches also intervene on the assumption that the child knows what normal regulation feels like. Most of these children however have only known chaos and fear novelty. This attachment based intervention model incorporates neurological, physiological, observational and practical regulation intervention strategies for anyone working with children with complex trauma history. It is able to be applied in home, school, community and in therapy environments. When a child feels regulated and safe, the effectiveness of the child’s trauma treatment can be enhanced. 0aClinical psychology. 0aPsychology. 0aCounseling. 0aSocial service. 0aOccupational therapy.14aClinical Psychology.24aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.24aCounseling Psychology.24aSocial Work.24aOccupational Therapy.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978303140319408iPrinted edition:z978303140321708iPrinted edition:z978303140322440uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-40320-0  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)05953nam a22005775i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204072001500227082001400242100008100256245011500337250001800452264008500470300004400555336002600599337002600625338003600651347002400687505033300711520367801044650002104722650002304743650002604766650001504792650002404807650001204831650002704843650002104870650002304891650002604914650001504940650002204955650002804977710003405005773002605039776003605065776003605101776003605137856004605173912001405219912001505233950006105248950006605309978-3-031-38860-6DE-He21320231027204825.0cr nn 008mamaa231027s2023    sz |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97830313886069978-3-031-38860-67 a10.1007/978-3-031-38860-62doi 4aQP360-360.7 7aJMM2bicssc 7aPSY0200002bisacsh 7aJMM2thema04a612.82231 aAuriemma, Vincenzo.eauthor.4aut4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut10aEmpathyh[electronic resource] :bThe Contribution of Neuroscience to Social Analysis /cby Vincenzo Auriemma.  a1st ed. 2023. 1aCham :bSpringer International Publishing :bImprint: Palgrave Macmillan,c2023.  aXIII, 244 p. 2 illus.bonline resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda0 a1.

Conclusions.  aThis book is an inquiry into the history of the concept of empathy. Using a strong trans-disciplinary approach at the crossroads of neurosciences, psychology and sociology, the author provides insights of possible application of the empirical research, making this work useful to scholars as well as people outside the academia. - Prof. Gabriele Balbi, University of Italian Switzerland, Switzerland. This book examines the concept of empathy in sociological and neuroscientific discourses using innovative perspectives from sociology and social neuroscience. Through a transdisciplinary approach, the author delves into the history of empathy and its social, cultural and semantic changes, and then reviews the conception of empathy in neuroscientific discourse. Distancing itself from the traditional neuroscientific literature of biological universalism, this volume offers an innovative perspective on empathy. It also opens a new avenue for neurosociology, which is presented as the discipline that can emphasize all the cultural and emotional aspects that govern empathy. Key themes addressed in the text are: empathy in all its meanings, from Hume to TenHouten; neurosociology as one possible avenue for embracing the cultural and neuroscientific aspects of empathy; and empirical research. A valuable resource for sociology students and academics in the field of empathy and neurosociology, this book is also of interest to those studying sociological thought, and social neuroscience. Vincenzo Auriemma is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Salerno, Italy, and an expert in the History of Sociological Thought.

AI and related technologies are increasingly prevalent in business and society and are beginning to be applied to healthcare. These technologies have the potential to transform many aspects of patient care, as well as administrative processes within provider, payer, and pharmaceutical organizations. There are already a number of research studies suggesting that AI can perform as well as or better than humans at key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing disease. Today, algorithms are already outperforming radiologists at spotting malignant tumors and guiding researchers in how to construct cohorts for costly clinical trials. However, for a variety of reasons, the authors believe that it will be many years before AI replaces humans for broad medical process domains. Through this book, the authors describe both the potential that AI offers to automate aspects of care and some of the barriers to rapid implementation of AI in healthcare. 0aPsychology.14aBehavioral Sciences and Psychology.1 aYadav, Dharmendra Kumar.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt1 aGulati, Anamika.eeditor.4edt4http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer Nature eBook08iPrinted edition:z978981996471008iPrinted edition:z978981996473408iPrinted edition:z978981996474140uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-6472-7  aZDB-2-BSP  aZDB-2-SXBP  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (SpringerNature-41168)  aBehavioral Science and Psychology (R0) (SpringerNature-43718)
